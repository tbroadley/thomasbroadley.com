title: Unlocking SSH keys using pass
description: My setup for automatically unlocking SSH keys with passwords stored in pass, the standard Unix password manager.

  <p>
    I use
    <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/"><code>pass</code></a> as my
    password manager. It stores passwords and other secrets as
    GPG-encrypted files in a Git repository. I host that repo on GitHub
    and have clones of it on my work and personal computers. I store
    nearly all of my personal passwords in <code>pass</code>, including
    passwords for my GitHub SSH keys. I’ve gone through three ways of
    unlocking these SSH keys.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started by running <code>pass -c SSH/Ubuntu</code> to copy my SSH
    key’s password to the keyboard, running a Git command like
    <code>git push</code>, then pasting my password into the prompt. I
    wasn’t satisfied with how much typing this process required. Plus,
    sometimes I’d forget to copy the password to my clipboard before
    running the Git command. I’d have to Ctrl+C that command and rerun it
    after copying the password. Even though I used
    <code>ssh-agent</code> and wasn’t unlocking my SSH key that often, I
    decided to automate this process.
  </p>

  <p>
    My second method used a script I called <code>sshpass</code>. Here it
    is in its entirety:
  </p>

  <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/expect -f
  set password [exec pass SSH/Ubuntu]

  spawn ssh-add
  expect "passphrase"
  send -- "$password\r"
  interact</code></pre>

  <p>
    This is an <code>expect</code> script. According to
    <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/expect">its man page</a>,
    <code>expect</code> is “a program that ‘talks’ to other interactive
    programs according to a script”. In this case, the script instructs
    <code>expect</code> to store the output of
    <code>pass SSH/Ubuntu</code> in the variable <code>password</code>,
    then run <code>ssh-add</code>, wait for it to prompt for a password,
    and write the password to <code>ssh-add</code>’s stdin. For reasons I
    don’t totally understand, the <code>interact</code> command, which
    attaches the terminal’s standard streams to <code>ssh-add</code>’s, is
    necessary to let <code>ssh-add</code> finish running.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, all I had to do was run <code>sshpass</code> before running a Git
    command, but I’d still sometimes forget to run <code>sshpass</code>.
    Finally, this week, I came across a third solution that addresses this
    issue on Linux, mainly based on
    <a
      href="https://blog.ona.io/technology/2020/03/02/using-password-manager-with-ssh.html"
      >this blog post</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, I added <code>AddKeysToAgent yes</code> to my SSH configuration
    at <code>~/.ssh/config</code>. This causes <code>ssh</code> to add
    keys to <code>ssh-agent</code> when they’re unlocked. This is
    important because we’ll no longer be explicitly calling
    <code>ssh-add</code>.
  </p>

  <p>Then, I added the following to my <code>.zshrc</code>:</p>

  <pre><code>eval $(ssh-agent) > /dev/null
  export SSH_ASKPASS=~/ssh-pass-passphrase.bash
  alias ssh="setsid -w ssh"
  alias git="setsid -w git"</code></pre>

  <p>
    This starts an instance of <code>ssh-agent</code>, then sets the
    <code>SSH_ASKPASS</code> environment variable. If this variable is
    set, when <code>ssh</code> needs a password to unlock an SSH key, it
    runs the script pointed at by the variable and uses the output as the
    password. Note that this only works if <code>ssh</code> isn’t run in a
    terminal. That’s the purpose of the aliases for <code>ssh</code> and
    <code>git</code>: <code>setsid</code> runs these programs in a new
    shell session that isn’t associated with the terminal in which I’m
    running <code>ssh</code> or <code>git</code>. The <code>-w</code> flag
    causes <code>setsid</code> to wait until <code>ssh</code> or
    <code>git</code> exits before exiting.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>~/ssh-pass-passphrase.bash</code> is a script that writes my SSH
    key’s password to stdout:
  </p>

  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
  pass SSH/Ubuntu</code></pre>

  <p>
    Now, I can run Git commands without worrying if my SSH key is unlocked
    beforehand. If it isn’t, <code>ssh</code> automatically calls
    <code>pass</code> to get my SSH key’s password and unlocks the key
    before Git runs the command.
  </p>

  <p>
    So far, this setup only works on Ubuntu on my personal computer. My
    next step is to get it working on Mac OS, so I can use it on my work
    computer too. After that, I’d like to look into ways to avoid spawning
    an instance of <code>ssh-agent</code> in every terminal I run this
    command in.
