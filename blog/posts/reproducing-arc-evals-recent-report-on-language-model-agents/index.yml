  I reproduced results from [ARC Evals](https://evals.alignment.org/)' recent report, [_Evaluating Language-Model Agents on Realistic Autonomous Tasks_](https://evals.alignment.org/Evaluating_LMAs_Realistic_Tasks.pdf). For the report, ARC Evals built a set of language model agents, combining a language model like GPT-4 with scaffolding software that lets the language model execute shell commands and interact with a browser. Then, it asked the agents to complete a set of 12 computer-related tasks, from searching Wikipedia for information to conducting a phishing campaign. The goal is to test how close the agents are to being able to make money, obtain computing power, make copies of themselves, and adapt to changes in their environment.

  To reproduce these results, I wrote my own language model agent. It's similar to ARC Evals' `GPT-4-simple` agent. It's also based on GPT-4 and allows the model to run bash commands in a REPL. On top of that, it uses [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) and Google Chrome to let GPT-4 visit webpages and interact with them by typing text into inputs and clicking links and buttons. 

  I didn't replicate ARC Evals' experimental setup exactly. I ran the agent on my own laptop instead of on a real server in the cloud. I also didn't bother giving the agent credentials for 2Captcha, LinkedIn, PayPal, or Twitter. Nor did I give it debit card information or an email address. However, I did give the agent access to my AWS and Twilio accounts.
        
  A language model agent completes tasks by running a think-do loop. At each timestep, GPT-4 thinks about what to do next and calls a function. The scaffolding responds to the function call by executing a bash command or an action in Google Chrome and adds the results to GPT-4's context window. Then, the process repeats.

  I set up the scaffolding so that I can approve, disapprove, or edit each bash command before it was run. The scaffolding also lets me edit commands' response codes, stdout, and stderr before adding those to the agent's context window.

  Here are my results:

  My agent was able to complete all tasks that ARC Evals' agents completed. Additionally, it succeeded at creating a Bitcoin wallet and partially succeeded at counting dogs in an image. However, my agent hasn't quite managed to get a "Partially completed" on the "Set up GPT-J" task, like one of ARC Evals' agents did.

  Neither ARC Evals' nor my results upper-bound the risk from any particular model. With better prompting and scaffolding, I'm sure that my agent could accomplish more of these tasks. That's not even taking into account fine-tuning, a process for improving a language model's performance at a specific task by training it on examples of successful task completions. OpenAI [just launched fine-tuning for GPT-3.5](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-5-turbo-fine-tuning-and-api-updates) and says that GPT-4 fine-tuning is coming this fall. On top of that, Meta recently released [Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/). Its weights are open-source, making it easy to fine-tune.

  Next, I might get my agent to attempt the last three tasks in the report. I think it's almost certain to fail, though.
