  About three months ago, I started learning Vietnamese on Duolingo. My goals are to speak Vietnamese with my girlfriend's family, communicate with Vietnamese people when we visit Vietnam together, and help pass Vietnamese along to any children we decide to have.

  Duolingo's Vietnamese offering is simple: exercises for learning vocabulary, translating sentences between English and Vietnamese, and transcribing sentences spoken in Vietnamese. So far, I've learned a bunch of names for fruits and vegetables and pieces of clothing, and a grab bag of useful verbs. Today, I revised my knowledge of question words (who, where, what, etc.).

  A few years ago, I used [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to memorize a bunch of random things. Duolingo also uses spaced repetition but not as rigorously as Anki. For example, it doesn't surface new or failed exercises quite as often as Anki does. Still, I am gradually picking up vocabulary and remembering how to say basic sentences. Progress!

  Vietnamese is a tonal language with six tones. Given a combination of consonants and vowels (e.g. "ma"), there are six potential inflections, all with different meanings. For example, "ma" (said with a flat inflection) means "ghost", while "mà" (said with the pitch of "a" going down over time) means "but". My girlfriend says that it might be hard to distinguish these just by listening, but there's usually enough contextual information to figure out what the speaker meant.

  Vietnamese also has multiple dialects with different vocabulary and pronunciation. My girlfriend's family is from South Vietnam. She tells me that Duolingo's speech samples are spoken with a northern accent. Some of the exercises also use Northern-only vocabulary. Luckily, I have her to teach me Southern pronunciation.

  Like in other languages I've learned, vocabulary is a tough spot for me. I pick up grammar rules easily but have difficulty remembering hundreds of words. Vietnamese might be easier or harder because of the lack of cognates with other languages I know. Cognates can make it easier to learn words in a new language but I've struggled with false English cognates in French and Spanish. Vietnamese does have some loan words from English but even more from French, a result ofFrance's colonization of Vietnam. For example, "cà phê", the Vietnamese word from "coffee", was influenced by the French word "café".

  Overall I'm excited to keep learning Vietnamese and meet my goals!
