    Recently I’ve been learning how to type using the
    <a href="https://workmanlayout.org/">Workman keyboard layout</a>. I’ve
    heard many times that QWERTY isn’t very ergonomic. I decided to learn
    a new keyboard layout to see how it’d affect my typing speed,
    accuracy, and comfort, and because it seemed like an interesting
    challenge. I must admit I didn’t do much research into the other
    alternative layouts. Basically, Workman’s excellent website convinced
    me to try it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve been practicing around 15 minutes a day for the past two weeks.
    I’ve considered practicing more, but honestly I don’t find the process
    that fun. Plus, I already spend a lot of time typing, using my phone,
    and playing the piano and bass, so I don’t want to put too much more
    strain on my hands.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m using <a href="https://keybr.com">Keybr</a> to learn Workman. It
    teaches you to type using many short lessons, 20 or 25 words each by
    default, composed of a randomly-generated mix of real and fake words.
    The fake words are either short, English-like sequences of letters or
    portmanteaus of two real words. You learn one letter at a time, only
    moving onto the next letter once you’ve mastered the current one.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started using Keybr to improve my QWERTY typing but found it
    annoying to use. I think that’s because I have word-level muscle
    memory for that keyboard layout. The fake words threw me off because
    they didn't exist in my muscle memory.
  </p>

  <p>
    Keybr works well for learning a new keyboard layout, though. Because
    of the fake words, the lessons don’t force you to type any one word
    too often, but are still full of common sequences of two to four keys
    containing the letter you’re currently learning. My hypothesis is that
    word-level muscle memory is built on top of muscle memory for these
    sequences. While learning a new key, I first gain muscle memory for
    the sequences enabled by introducing that key. For example, I learned
    I and N before learning G, so the lessons only included words ending
    in “ing” once I started learning G. Besides these sequences, I also
    build muscle memory for words of four letters or fewer that contain
    the new key. I then develop muscle memory for longer words. I looked
    for studies on motor learning that agreed or disagreed with this
    observation but couldn’t find any.
  </p>

  <p>
    I noticed a couple of factors that made a given key easier or more
    difficult to learn. It’s easy to analyze them using this graph from my
    Keybr profile:
  </p>

  <p class="image">
    <img
      alt="A graph from my Keybr profile. The x-axis is the typing lesson number, from 1 to 307. Each key has a row on the y-axis, sorted vertically by the lesson I started learning it. Each intersection of a lesson and a key contains a small rectangle, ranging from red for low speed and accuracy to green for high speed and accuracy (or white if I didn't practice that key in that lesson)."

    />
  </p>

  <p>
    The graph’s x-axis is the typing lesson number. You can see I’ve done
    307 Workman lessons so far. Red sections represent lessons with lower
    speed and accuracy for that key, while green indicates higher speed
    and accuracy.
  </p>

  <p>
    I found it easy to learn letters that Workman and QWERTY assigned to
    the same key. Unfortunately, only three of the letter keys I've
    learned so far are in the same location: A, S, and G. The graph above
    demonstrates that I quickly learned A and S and haven’t lost that
    proficiency since. G has been more challenging, perhaps because it
    doesn’t appear in every lesson.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was also easier to learn letters that only showed up in short
    words. For example, in my first lessons for K, the letter appeared
    almost exclusively in three- or four-letter words like “take” and
    “ack”. According to the graph, it only took me a few lessons to learn
    K initially. However, when a later lesson reintroduced it in a longer
    word, I struggled to remember it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, learning certain keys completely threw off my muscle memory
    for the keys I’d already learned. It was like my brain had to break
    down and restructure my existing muscle memory to take into account
    the new key.
  </p>

  <p>
    Take the R key as an example. It was one of the first six keys I
    learned. It only took me a few lessons to master it. However, my speed
    and accuracy for R have fallen several times while learning other keys
    (e.g. A and M). I’ve gone through a similar process of gaining and
    losing muscle memory with other keys, most dramatically D, H, and B.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s frustrating to get less proficient at a key. I wonder whether it
    would have been faster to learn how to type all the keys at once
    instead of one at a time. I think I would have abandoned the process
    because of the steeper learning curve, though.
  </p>

  <p>
    So far, I’ve learned all the letter keys except for Z, X, Q, and J.
    After learning those, to help me build word-level muscle memory, I
    might switch from Keybr to a different typing practice tool that
    emphasizes typing real words and sentences. I might practice with
    <a href="https://github.com/tbroadley/gpt-2-github">a tool</a> I
    developed that uses GPT-2 to generate typing lessons based on a GitHub
    user’s PR comments. The goal of this project is to let me practice
    typing text that’s as similar to the text I’m typing on a daily basis
    as possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ll also try out Workman at work and in my personal life. I found it
    easy to install the layout on Mac OS by following the instructions
    <a href="https://github.com/workman-layout/Workman/tree/master/mac"
      >here</a
    >. Ubuntu is more challenging. The GitHub repository I just linked to
    contains instructions for four different ways to enable Workman on
    Ubuntu. I don’t run <code>xfree86</code>, so that method isn’t an
    option. The <code>linux_console</code> and
    <code>xorg</code> approaches don’t work on my computer—I think they
    might only work on an older version of Ubuntu. The
    <code>xmodmap</code> approach enables Workman in Firefox but not in my
    terminal. I’ll have to keep investigating.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ll write another post once I’ve determined if Workman helps me type
    faster, more accurately, or with less effort. Even if I go back to
    QWERTY, learning Workman has already paid dividends: The process has
    improved my QWERTY typing. I’ve started using the “correct” fingers on
    more distant keys. For example, I now use my right ring finger to type
    O and P, instead of my middle finger. I’m not sure how to quantify the
    impact of this, but I think it’ll slightly reduce the strain of
    typing.
