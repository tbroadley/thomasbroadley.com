      <section>
        <p>
          In just over a week, I’m quitting my job as a software developer at
          Faire. Over my four-and-a-half years at Faire, I’ve seen the company
          undergo an order of magnitude of growth in both employees and
          customers. I’ve learned a lot from many excellent mentors and
          managers. It’s a bittersweet departure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why am I leaving? For one thing, in less than a month, my wife and I
          are moving to Los Angeles so she can attend music production school. I
          hoped Faire would sponsor me for a US work visa but they declined to
          do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that’s not the only reason that it’s time for me to leave. For a
          few years, I’ve been concerned about the risk of humanity going
          extinct because of artificial intelligence. Humanity can probably
          invent AI that’s much more capable than any human. If we do, I expect
          it to go poorly for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until last December, I thought that this kind of AI was decades away.
          After ChatGPT launched, I realized that there was a real chance I was
          wrong about that. I started applying to AI safety workshops, programs,
          grants, and jobs (no acceptances yet). I spoke to an advisor from
          80,000 Hours, an organization that helps people have high-impact
          careers. I attended EA Global: London, a conference that many AI
          safety researchers attend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eight months later, I’m still very confused about how I can best help
          reduce AI x-risk. That’s partially because I’ve still spent little
          time thinking about it. It’s hard to come to grips with my belief that
          humanity could be extinct within a decade. Also, different people have
          wildly different opinions on extinction from AI, all the way from
          “it’s almost impossible” to “it’s almost certain”. It’s hard to sort
          through everyone’s arguments and approaches for tackling the problem.
          Finally, I have some sympathy for other people’s arguments that
          current AI safety research isn’t actually reducing AI x-risk. This has
          made it hard to find the motivation to become a researcher.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, I believe that this is the most important thing I can work on.
          I want to make a real effort to have an impact. That’s why I’m not
          looking for a traditional software developer job right now. I’m
          planning to spend a few months figuring out how I can most effectively
          reduce this risk. Nothing is off the table. Maybe I should become a
          computer security expert and work at Anthropic, Google Deepmind, or
          OpenAI. Maybe I should learn about policy and help set up AI
          governance systems. Maybe there isn’t a good way for me to help right
          now and I’ll try to help with some other major global problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I’m scared. I suspect my current work habits and intrinsic
          motivation aren’t up to the task of figuring this out, but it’ll be
          hard to change them. Also, I need a stronger network of supportive,
          like-minded individuals. I hope I find this among LA rationalists and
          effective altruists.
        </p>
        <p>Wish me luck.</p>
