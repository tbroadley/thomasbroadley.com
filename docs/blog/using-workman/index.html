          On May 12, I completed my first lessons using the
          <a href="https://workmanlayout.org/">Workman keyboard layout</a> on
          <a href="https://www.keybr.com/">Keybr</a>. On May 25, I started
          practicing seriously, spending 15 minutes a day each day from then
          until June 11. By June 9 I’d learned all the new layout’s letter keys.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I thought I might in my last post, on June 13, I started practicing
          using <a href="https://www.typingclub.com">TypingClub</a> instead of
          Keybr. I hoped that typing real words and sentences only would help me
          build word-level muscle memory faster. TypingClub also trains me on
          capital letters and punctuation. Keybr can train you on these too, and
          more intensely than TypingClub: Every word can be capitalized or end
          with punctuation. However I thought I’d learn these keys more quickly
          by using them in real-world contexts.
        </p>

        <p class="image">

            alt="A screenshot of a TypingClub lesson about African languages. The first two sentences of the passage are visible. The first sentence has already been typed. Letters typed correctly the first time are highlighted in green, those typed incorrectly and then correctly in yellow. A bar at the bottom shows my progress through the lesson."
          />
        </p>

        <p>
          TypingClub is an OK resource for those learning to type. It offers a
          full course in touch-typing but I skipped ahead to its advanced
          lessons, which involve typing a three-to-five-sentence biography of a
          person or summary of a concept. The website’s clearly aimed towards
          students: The lessons use a middle- or high-school reading level and
          some are about plagiarism and online bullying. It’s also focused on
          Western culture, with many lessons on American historical figures,
          authors, and politics. I found the lesson UI, which shows how fast you
          type each word and your speed and accuracy for the current lesson,
          pretty distracting and hid most of these UI elements using uBlock
          Origin. Overall TypingClub is useful but I imagine better services
          exist for adults.
        </p>

        <p>
          On June 23 I had a scare. As I wrote in my journal, “I thought I’d
          totally lost my QWERTY muscle memory. I did some typing practice, then
          switched back to QWERTY [...] and found it really difficult to type
          accurately.” Luckily, after an hour or so, my QWERTY muscle memory
          came back. This incident taught me not to practice Workman right
          before work. Another time I did so, I typed slower and less accurately
          than usual for most of the workday. By contrast, this morning I
          practiced Workman, then showered and went for a walk. I started work
          an hour after I finished practicing and had no trouble using QWERTY.
        </p>

        <p>
          I haven’t been as diligent about practicing daily with TypingClub as I
          was with Keybr. I missed a couple of days in mid-June and four last
          week (partly because I went on vacation without a computer). Still,
          I’ve increased my Workman typing speed by about 13 words per minute
          (wpm) in the past month:
        </p>

        <p class="image">
          <img
            src="typing-speed-graph.png"
            alt="A graph of my Workman typing speed over the past month. Each data point is the speed at which I typed when taking together all lessons completed on that day. A linear trendline with R2 = 0.655 goes from about 39 wpm on June 13 to about 52 wpm on July 10."
          />
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately this is faster than my real-world typing speed. I find I
          type faster when I can always see the next letter I need to type, as
          with Keybr and TypingClub but not when typing a chat message. But the
          change in speed feels roughly accurate. I think a small amount of this
          increase comes from higher accuracy but most is from improved muscle
          memory, both at the three-or-four-letter sequence level and at the
          word level.
        </p>

        <p>
          My speed isn’t improving as quickly as I’d like, which is why on July
          5 I started using Workman full-time on my personal computer. So far
          it’s been slow going. I still haven’t found a way to use the same
          keyboard layout across all programs. My current solution affects
          Firefox and Discord but not my terminal emulator or Ubuntu settings.
          As I discovered, it’s difficult to switch quickly between layouts, so
          I need to find a better solution. I also discovered that the Workman
          keymap I’m using has a couple of bugs: the Caps Lock key is bound to
          both caps lock and backspace, and the left arrow key doesn’t work at
          all. The keymap is open-source so I’ll contribute the fixes back to
          the original project if I fix these issues before finding a different
          way to use Workman on Ubuntu (a friend of mine suggested a
          programmable keyboard).
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m still a ways from using Workman at work. I’m currently relearning
          common shortcuts like opening and closing new tabs, and even copy and
          paste. More importantly, I haven’t figured out how to avoid disrupting
          my Vim muscle memory. I’ll definitely rebind HJKL (equivalents for the
          arrow keys) to YNEO (the letters on the Workman keyboard triggered by
          the same keys as HJKL on QWERTY). But should I also rebind often-used
          Vim keys like I, A, Y, and P so that they don’t change position, or
          should I relearn the positions and keep the mnemonic key bindings
          (Insert, Append, Yank, and Paste respectively)? I haven’t decided yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          In any case, I’ll keep using Workman, with the goal of using it at
          work too. It’s subjective and potentially biased, but this keyboard
          layout does feel easier on my hands than QWERTY. I typed this blog
          post using Workman: Here’s to many more.
        </p>

        <p>
          P.S.: Here are two fun facts. First, this whole process hasn’t
          affected my phone-typing muscle memory at all. (It makes sense: Typing
          Workman on a keyboard is much more like typing QWERTY on a keyboard
          than typing QWERTY on a phone.) Second, it’s quite difficult to type
          the word “QWERTY” using Workman… Someday I’ll build the word-level
          muscle memory for it.
