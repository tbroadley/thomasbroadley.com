          I started the day by adding three new plugins to my Vim setup, after
          learning about them from a thread on RC’s Zulip:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim"
              ><code>coc.nvim</code></a
            >
            (language-specific autocomplete and jump to definition)
          </li>

          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim"
              ><code>fzf.vim</code></a
            >
            (fuzzy search for anything, but I’m only using it to open files
            right now)
          </li>

          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive"
              ><code>fugitive.vim</code></a
            >
            (Git commands)
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          That took most of the morning, perhaps more time than I should have
          spent on it. I did learn about Vimscript and worked around one gotcha
          that’s good material for another post.
        </p>

        <p>
          Late in the morning I caught the end of daily check-ins. Participants
          take turns briefly explaining what they worked on yesterday and what
          they’re working on today. I’ll definitely be attending the entire
          meeting tomorrow: It was a great way to hear about interesting
          projects that others are working on. I also found it handy to be able
          to reference my “RC day 1” post while giving my check-in.
        </p>

        <p>
          After lunch I attended a workshop on pair programming. I’ve paired
          quite a bit before but still learned something new. For example, one
          benefit of pairing I hadn’t considered was that it’s harder to get
          distracted for minutes by social media when pairing. (I do still find
          myself getting distracted for 30 seconds at a time by Slack. Something
          for me to work on.)
        </p>

        <p>
          I also picked up a few new pairing tips:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Swap roles every 8-15 minutes (the driver becomes the navigator and
            vice versa)
          </li>

          <li>
            Take short breaks every so often
          </li>

          <li>
            Don’t pair on a task that’s trivial for both people
          </li>

          <li>
            Focus on transferring and receiving knowledge instead of achieving a
            result in a set amount of time
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We then put those tips into practice by pairing with other Recursers
          to implement the Game of Life.
        </p>

        <p>
          After the workshop, I had a coffee chat with someone who’s been at RC
          for a few weeks already. She gave me some good advice: Even though my
          time at RC is flying by, the experience doesn’t end along with my
          batch. I can still attend study groups and other events after this
          week. And I’m already thinking about coming back for a six- or
          twelve-week batch.
        </p>

        <p>
          Early in the day, I posted on Zulip asking to chat with people about
          their experiences with code review. I hoped to figure out whether
          <a href="https://github.com/tbroadley/literate-diffs"
            >Literate Diffs</a
          >
          solves a real problem. A few people expressed interest and I spoke
          with a couple of them late this afternoon. One had already noticed the
          exact problem that Literate Diffs aims to solve. The other had already
          solved the problem a different way at his company. They found it
          harder to build systems for determining who should review which PRs.
          Definitely food for thought.
        </p>

        <p>
          Somewhere along the way, I started a Google Doc containing interesting
          links that others had shared with me or posted on Zulip. Currently it
          contains Wikipedia articles, blog posts, and Amazon pages for a few
          books. After this week I’ll run through it and consolidate that
          knowledge somehow.
        </p>

        <p>
          I spent longer than I intended catching up on my RSS feed. I feel bad
          about the lost productivity, but maybe my brain needed the break. I’ll
          push myself a little harder tomorrow.
        </p>

        <p>
          Speaking of tomorrow! In the morning, I want to come up with a plan of
          attack for Literate Diffs and start executing against it. Right now,
          the best strategy seems to be fleshing out my old React prototype,
          then asking people to play around with it. I also want to pair
          again—I’ve signed up for a session with a Zulip bot that matches you
          with other people looking for pairing partners. If there’s time, I’ll
          try to get
          <a href="https://github.com/nicwest/vim-workman"
            ><code>vim-workman</code></a
          >
          to play nice with macros.
        </p>

        <p>
          P.S. Writing this blog post made me realize how annoying it is to
          write HTML without macros. Tomorrow I'll also look at adding Markdown
          support to my blog generator.
