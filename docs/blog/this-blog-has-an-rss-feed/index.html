      <section>
        <p>
          I recently added an
          <a href="https://thomasbroadley.com/blog/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> to my
          blog, prompted by a friend asking if I had one. I write these posts in
          HTML. I don’t use a static site generator. So I assumed I wouldn’t be
          able to generate a feed using existing software. (Later, I realized
          there exist tools that build an RSS feed from a given webpage. I
          looked at one and saw the feed it built didn’t have anywhere near the
          format I wanted.)
        </p>

        <p>
          I wrote
          <a
            href="https://github.com/tbroadley/thomasbroadley.com/blob/35270f4/blog/rss/index.ts"
            >a small TypeScript program</a
          >
          to generate the RSS feed. It uses
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/htmlparser2"
            ><code>htmlparser2</code></a
          >
          to parse the posts and
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rss"><code>rss</code></a> to
          generate the RSS feed from the contents.
        </p>

        <h2>The right tool for the job</h2>

        <p>
          I soon realized <code>htmlparser2</code> wasn’t the easiest tool to
          use. The library uses a callback interface: It lets you provide
          functions that it then calls when it encounters opening and closing
          tags, text nodes, and other document features. It’s up to the code
          using the library to track its location in the parse tree.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, I could have used a library like
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse5"><code>parse5</code></a
          >, which parses the HTML into a JavaScript object and makes it easy to
          access elements with known locations in the parse tree. It’s a
          tradeoff, though: If I’d written the script using that approach, small
          changes in the layout of the HTML would have broken it. In fact, I
          think it would have been easiest to write this script using browser
          APIs like <code>Document#querySelector</code>. For that reason, maybe
          I should have used a DOM implementation like
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom"><code>jsdom</code></a
          >.
        </p>

        <h2>Parsing the posts</h2>

        <p>
          In any case, solving this problem with <code>htmlparser2</code> was a
          fun challenge. I wanted to extract three pieces of information from
          each post: its title and creation date and the post body. First, I
          worked on extracting the title.
        </p>

        <p>
          I added callbacks for opening tags, closing tags, and text nodes.
          <code>htmlparser2</code> does a pre-order traversal of the parse tree:
          If you identify the calls to the opening and closing tag callbacks for
          a given element, any calls to the text node callback in between must
          be for text nodes inside that element. Each post’s
          <code>title</code> tag contains the title, so all I had to do was
          extract the text node inside that tag. Since each post only has one
          <code>title</code> tag, I did this by setting an
          <code>inTitle</code> variable to true when I saw an opening
          <code>title</code> tag, storing the contents of the text node seen
          when <code>inTitle</code> was true in a second variable, and setting
          <code>inTitle</code> to false on a closing <code>title</code> tag.
        </p>

        <p>
          I did something similar to extract the creation date, which is
          contained in a <code>p</code> tag with the class
          <code>timestamp</code>. The opening tag callback takes a map of HTML
          attributes as well as a tag name, so it was easy to recognize this
          particular <code>p</code> tag by its class. The closing tag callback
          doesn’t provide the tag’s attributes, but I realized I could set
          <code>inDate</code> to false on any closing <code>p</code> tag, since
          the paragraph containing the timestamp doesn’t have any paragraphs
          inside it.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting the post contents</h2>

        <p>
          Extracting the contents of each post was more difficult. The body of
          each blog post lives in a <code>section</code> tag. It can contain
          HTML itself—so far I’ve mainly used <code>a</code> and
          <code>code</code> tags. However, <code>htmlparser2</code> doesn’t let
          you read the contents of a specific HTML element. It just calls your
          callback functions when it sees opening tags, closing tags, and text
          nodes. I needed to rebuild the HTML inside the
          <code>section</code> tag only using the information from these
          function calls.
        </p>

        <p>
          To keep track of whether it’s inside the <code>section</code> tag, the
          script uses an <code>inSection</code> Boolean variable, similar to how
          it keeps track of whether it’s inside the <code>title</code> tag. It
          appends any text it sees inside the <code>section</code> tag to a
          <code>content</code> string variable that starts off empty. When the
          script sees an opening tag inside the <code>section</code> tag, it
          uses the tag name and map of attributes to build a string containing
          an HTML opening tag, then appends it to <code>content</code>. This
          logic closes self-closing tags but leaves other tags open. On
          encountering a closing tag inside the <code>section</code>, the script
          appends a closing tag to <code>content</code>, as long as the tag
          isn’t self-closing. The pre-order traversal ensures the script appends
          tags and text to <code>content</code> in the same order it appears in
          the original post.
        </p>

        <h2>Generating the RSS feed</h2>

        <p>
          Generating the feed was simpler. Each post lives in its own folder, so
          the script gets a list of those folders, reads and parses each post,
          adds an item to the feed for each parsed post, and writes the feed to
          an XML file. After running the script, I commit the updated file to my
          website’s Git repository and push to publish.
        </p>

        <h2>Why TypeScript?</h2>

        <p>
          I wrote this script in TypeScript but didn’t benefit much from doing
          so compared to writing it in JavaScript. Most of the compile errors I
          encountered would have been runtime errors in JS, but the cause would
          have been equally obvious. On the other hand, I didn’t waste much time
          using TS. It didn’t take long to install <code>ts-node</code> and type
          definitions for the libraries I was using, and I don’t expect
          <code>ts-node</code> was much slower than Node for such a small
          script. Plus, I would have benefited more from TS with a different
          development environment. I wrote this script using Vim, without even
          TS syntax highlighting. If I’d used an IDE with type-aware code
          completion and integrated type-checking, or installed Vim plugins for
          those features, TS would have been an improvement over JS.
        </p>

        <h2>Why RSS?</h2>

        <p>
          So why RSS? I’m a big consumer of RSS feeds myself and I know I’m not
          alone, even if they’re not as popular as they used to be. RSS is a
          simple way to share new content with people interested in your work.
          Of course, it’s not the only way. I could share my posts over Twitter
          or Facebook, but I started using RSS in the first place to get off
          social media. (A topic for another post.) Substack and Mailchimp make
          it easy to share content over email, but I like having full control
          over the distribution of my posts. I’d rather not give that control to
          a third party, at least for a passion project that I don’t plan to
          monetize, like this blog. I’d definitely consider using Substack for a
          paid newsletter to avoid integrating with a payment processor.
        </p>

        <h2>P.S.: Why not an SSG or a CMS?</h2>

        <p>
          It’s also worth examining why I don’t use a static site generator or a
          CMS for my blog. I certainly could have built it more quickly using
          one of those tools. Well, again, I like having full control over my
          website, both its appearance and its code. A tool like Wordpress
          doesn’t give you that control without a lot of customization. I also
          appreciate that my website’s code is simple and human-readable.
          Finally, I enjoy solving problems and writing software. I don’t see
          the time spent working on projects like this one as wasted. I even
          enjoy the process of turning each post into an HTML document. It’s a
          good Vim exercise and the process somehow makes me feel more proud of
          my posts.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <p>
          Edit: The day after publishing this blog post, I decided to move my
          posts into YAML files and generate both the HTML for them and my
          blog's RSS feed from those files. Each post shares a lot of code and
          it's painful to change something in all of them (e.g. adding a link to
          the header). Now that each post is based on a template HTML file, it's
          easy to make these kinds of changes. It's also a lot easier to parse
          YAML than HTML. And I still get to hand-edit each post's HTML!
          (Although I might look into generating them from Markdown instead.)
