          About three months ago, I started learning Vietnamese on Duolingo. My
          goals are to speak Vietnamese with my girlfriend's family, communicate
          with Vietnamese people when we visit Vietnam together, and help pass
          Vietnamese along to any children we decide to have.
        </p>
        <p>
          Duolingo's Vietnamese offering is simple: exercises for learning
          vocabulary, translating sentences between English and Vietnamese, and
          transcribing sentences spoken in Vietnamese. So far, I've learned a
          bunch of names for fruits and vegetables and pieces of clothing, and a
          grab bag of useful verbs. Today, I revised my knowledge of question
          words (who, where, what, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          A few years ago, I used
          <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> to memorize a bunch of
          random things. Duolingo also uses spaced repetition but not as
          rigorously as Anki. For example, it doesn't surface new or failed
          exercises quite as often as Anki does. Still, I am gradually picking
          up vocabulary and remembering how to say basic sentences. Progress!
        </p>
        <p>
          Vietnamese is a tonal language with six tones. Given a combination of
          consonants and vowels (e.g. "ma"), there are six potential
          inflections, all with different meanings. For example, "ma" (said with
          a flat inflection) means "ghost", while "mà" (said with the pitch of
          "a" going down over time) means "but". My girlfriend says that it
          might be hard to distinguish these just by listening, but there's
          usually enough contextual information to figure out what the speaker
          meant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vietnamese also has multiple dialects with different vocabulary and
          pronunciation. My girlfriend's family is from South Vietnam. She tells
          me that Duolingo's speech samples are spoken with a northern accent.
          Some of the exercises also use Northern-only vocabulary. Luckily, I
          have her to teach me Southern pronunciation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like in other languages I've learned, vocabulary is a tough spot for
          me. I pick up grammar rules easily but have difficulty remembering
          hundreds of words. Vietnamese might be easier or harder because of the
          lack of cognates with other languages I know. Cognates can make it
          easier to learn words in a new language but I've struggled with false
          English cognates in French and Spanish. Vietnamese does have some loan
          words from English but even more from French, a result ofFrance's
          colonization of Vietnam. For example, "cà phê", the Vietnamese word
          from "coffee", was influenced by the French word "café".
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall I'm excited to keep learning Vietnamese and meet my goals!
