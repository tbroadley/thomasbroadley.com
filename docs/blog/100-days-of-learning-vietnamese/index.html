        <p>
          I started learning Vietnamese on Duolingo three months ago. My goals
          are simple: to speak Vietnamese with my girlfriend's family, to
          communicate with locals on our future trips to Vietnam, and to teach
          Vietnamese to any children we might have.
        </p>
        <p>
          Duolingo offers exercises to learn vocabulary, translate sentences
          between English and Vietnamese, and transcribe spoken Vietnamese. I've
          already learned basic words for fruits, vegetables, and clothing, plus
          some useful verbs. Today, I practiced question words like "who" and
          "what."
        </p>
        <p>
          Vietnamese pronunciation doesn't depend on context. In this area, it's
          easier to learn Vietnamese than English. For example, in English, the
          "a" in "mat" is pronounced differently than the "a" in "mate". In
          Vietnamese, "a" has the same pronunciation in every word.
        </p>
        <p>
          To compensate for this, Vietnamese has 12 vowels ("a", "ă", "â", "e",
          "ê", "i", "y", "o", "ô", "ơ", "u", and "ư") and an extra consonant
          letter, "đ". I'm still practicing the pronunciations of some of these.
          In particular, "ư"−a nasal "u" sound—was tough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vietnamese also has multiple dialects with different pronunciation. My
          girlfriend's family is from South Vietnam, but Duolingo's speech
          samples have a Northern accent and include Northern-only vocabulary.
          Thankfully, my girlfriend is teaching me Southern pronunciation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vietnamese is the first tonal language I've learned. A single
          combination of consonant and vowel sounds (e.g., "ma") can have up to
          six different meanings depending on inflection. For example, "ma"
          (said with the same pitch all the way through) means "ghost", while
          "mà" (said with a falling pitch) means "but". It's a challenge to
          distinguish between these tones. However, my girlfriend tells me she
          often figures out words' tones from context.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, learning any language's vocabulary is tough. On top of this,
          Vietnamese has few cognates with other languages I know. (This does
          save me from false cognates, something I struggle with in French and
          Spanish.) Vietnamese does have many loan words from both English and
          French. For example, the French word "café" influenced "cà phê"
          (Vietnamese for "coffee").
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't expect that Vietnamese would have so many words that are fun
          to say. Two of my favourites so far are "thịt nướng" (meaning "grilled
          meat") and "xe đạp" (meaning "bicycle").
