        <p>
          Every company I’ve worked at enforces peer code review before merging
          and deploying a pull request. I’ve been thinking about ways to improve
          this process for a while. Today I asked myself: If developers didn’t
          do code review, what would they do to achieve the same results?
        </p>

        <p>
          First, we need to ask: What is code review for? I’ll divide its
          benefits into three categories. The first contains the benefits of
          using automated code review tools. Type checkers, linters, and code
          formatters aren’t the only tools in this space. We can also check that
          pull requests don’t reduce test coverage or introduce untested code
          paths. To some extent, we can automatically enforce naming and commit
          message conventions. Tools can flag misuses of language features, the
          language’s standard library, and other libraries. We can also use
          static analysis, benchmarking, and profiling to look for performance
          issues. There’s a lot of room for creativity here. For example, at
          Faire, we implemented a tool that indicates when a pull request
          increases the size of our main JavaScript bundle.
        </p>

        <p>
          The second category includes conventions and checks that require human
          reasoning. Reviewers check that a pull request satisfies the
          requirements of the feature it implements, that the code is
          well-tested, and that the tests correctly describe the expected
          behaviour. Reviewers also provide feedback on comments and
          documentation, and ask the author to rewrite or comment unclear code.
          Finally, I’ve seen reviewers question whether it makes sense to
          implement the proposed change at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          The third category contains the harder-to-quantify benefits of having
          more than one person look at each pull request. Developers feel
          ownership for the code they review and responsibility for bugs that it
          introduces. Code review is a great way to share knowledge, both from
          reviewer to reviewee and vice versa. It also means that at least two
          people should be familiar with every line of code in the codebase,
          reducing the team’s bus factor. Finally, to build a sense of
          solidarity, it’s important for developers on the same team to work
          together on a daily basis.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking at the benefits in the second and third categories, I see a
          common thread: They’re also the benefits of pair programming. While
          pairing, the observer can give the same kinds of feedback on code
          quality and functionality that a reviewer does. Even better, the
          driver gets this feedback as they’re writing the code, making it
          easier to integrate into the pull request. And pairing might be a
          better way to achieve the fuzzy goals in the third category, since
          developers collaborate in-person or over a voice or video call rather
          than through text.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don’t think pairing should completely replace code review. It’s
          possible that both developers working on a pull request are too close
          to the code and could benefit from a third opinion. Also, I find
          pairing more draining than writing code by myself. Some companies
          enforce constant pair programming—I wouldn’t be happy in that
          environment and I don’t think I’m alone.
        </p>

        <p>
          In any case, at the companies I’ve worked at, I’ve spent much more
          time reviewing code than pair programming. For example, this week, I
          spent about 90 minutes pairing and at least five hours reviewing code.
          I wonder what’d happen if we changed that balance. Perhaps we could
          encourage more pairing by waiving the code review requirement for pull
          requests that were paired on. That’d be an interesting experiment to
          run someday.
