        <p>
          RC began with a tour of
          <a href="https://www.recurse.com/virtual-rc">Virtual RC</a>, an online
          space that emulates the physical RC experience with all its
          serendipitous conversations. Then I attended talks by RC employees
          about the program and how to get the most out of it. Finally we broke
          into small groups and I briefly met a few other current attendees.
        </p>

        <p>
          I found a study group following
          <a href="https://cryptopals.com/">Cryptopals</a>, a series of
          programming challenges that introduce you to real-world cryptography
          and breaking said crypto. I didn’t attend the group, but I solved the
          first three challenges using Clojure. I’ve never programmed in that
          language and haven’t used a Lisp in a while, so it took time to get
          through them. I might work on the problems more but probably not in
          Clojure. I like Lispy syntax but missed static types and couldn’t find
          high-quality documentation for the standard library.
        </p>

        <p>
          After that I looked at an old project called
          <a href="https://github.com/tbroadley/literate-diffs"
            >Literate Diffs</a
          >. The pitch is literate programming for Git diffs. PR authors should
          be able to reorder chunks in their PRs and add commentary around them.
          I think this idea has the potential to make code review a lot easier
          for reviewers (with a little investment from authors). I might
          resurrect that project this week or tackle the idea from a different
          direction (a file format? A browser extension for GitHub and similar
          sites?).
        </p>

        <p>
          Honestly it was a slow day!
          <a href="../tags/workman">I’m switching from QWERTY to Workman</a> and
          still don’t have the hang of using Vim with this new layout. I’m using
          a package called
          <a href="https://github.com/nicwest/vim-workman"
            ><code>vim-workman</code></a
          >
          to let me use my QWERTY muscle memory in normal mode, which is helping
          a lot. In fact, this afternoon, I opened a couple of PRs on that repo.
          One was a documentation improvement, the second a fix for an issue. I
          filed another issue that I might take a crack at solving tomorrow.
        </p>

        <p>
          I didn’t pair with anyone today. To hit that goal for the rest of the
          week, I’m going to have to put myself out there more than I did today.
          But working on <code>vim-workman</code> gave me. Maybe I can build
          some tools to make myself more productive as a programmer, then do a
          presentation on them at the end of the week. Or even present on my
          Workman journey and the software I’ve used to get here.
