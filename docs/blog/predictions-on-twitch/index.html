      <section>
        <p>
          Recently, I’ve spent more time than usual watching Twitch streams,
          partially because of
          <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/channel-points-predictions"
            >Predictions</a
          >. On Twitch, viewers accumulate Channel Points by watching and
          interacting with a stream. Predictions lets streamers create events
          with outcomes that viewers can then bet on using Channel Points. For
          example, you could ask your viewers whether or not they think you’ll
          reach Grandmaster in League of Legends (LoL) today, or finish the
          pizza you’re eating.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, Predictions don’t make great prediction markets. You
          can’t switch your prediction, or even remove your bet. You can only
          increase your stake in the side you originally picked. Plus, streamers
          are meant to close Predictions before the predicted event has started.
          Finally, Predictions have a known time window for betting, but
          streamers can also manually close betting before the end of the
          window, so it’s risky to wait to get a sense of the odds.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m disappointed because Predictions seem liquid. On relatively small
          streams with a few hundred viewers, I’ve seen hundreds of thousands of
          channel points bet on each side of a Prediction. On the other hand,
          I’m not convinced most bets are rational - the odds sometimes swing
          wildly as longtime viewers bet large amounts of Channel Points.
        </p>
        <p>So far, I’ve seen Predictions for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The outcome of a LoL game</li>
          <li>
            An over/under on the number of kills a streamer will have in a LoL
            game
          </li>
          <li>
            An over/under on the time required to finish a level in Super Mario
            Maker 2
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Predictions seem like a fun way to practice predicting the future, but
          none of these use cases is perfect for that. Optimally, the predicted
          events would be short but have known starting conditions that affect
          the outcome. Team composition and lane matchups change the probability
          of winning a LoL game, but it takes 20-40 minutes to find out the
          result. By contrast, a bullet chess game takes a couple of minutes to
          play, but the only starting condition is whether the streamer is
          playing as white or black.
        </p>
        <p>
          One solution is to run multiple Predictions on an event. For example,
          I could start a LoL game, then run Predictions on whether I’ll get
          first blood, whether my team will take the first dragon, and so on.
          I’d need another person to help me run the Predictions during the
          game, though.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps I should start my own Twitch channel with suitable
          Predictions. As a streamer, I bet I could get some interesting
          information on my viewers’ under- or overconfidence using this
          feature.
