          I last documented my experience with the Workman keyboard layout in
          July. At the time I could type at a little over 50 wpm using it. I’d
          just made it the main keyboard layout on my personal computer, but
          hadn’t found a way to apply the layout to all programs. By practicing
          daily, I hoped to improve to a point where I’d feel comfortable using
          Workman at work too.
        </p>
        <p>
          That didn’t really pan out. I quit regular typing practice a couple of
          weeks after publishing that post. I kept using Workman on my own
          computer, but would switch back to QWERTY when coding outside of work.
          And I never got around to trying it on my work computer. My goal to
          use Workman everywhere ended up on the back burner for a couple of
          months.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until the end of September. I took a week off to
          <a href="../tags/rc-mini-7-2020"
            >participate in a Recurse Center mini-batch</a
          >
          and decided to use the time to practice Workman. I wouldn’t use QWERTY
          for anything, not even coding. (Luckily, the weekend before RC, I
          found out how to enable Workman system-wide on Ubuntu! Note to self:
          Post the solution. If it was non-obvious to me, it’s non-obvious to
          someone else.)
        </p>
        <p>
          That week, I spent more time than I would have liked fiddling with my
          <code>.vimrc</code>. I wanted to set up Vim to use QWERTY key
          locations in normal mode and Workman locations in insert mode, so my
          muscle memory wouldn’t immediately become useless. I installed a
          plugin but found a couple of bugs. I fixed one of them but lost
          patience with the other, so I started writing my own key mapping. For
          unknown reasons it didn’t work consistently. At this point, I was
          pretty tired of writing Vimscript. Plus, I was unconsciously using
          Workman key locations in normal mode half the time anyway. I decided
          to get rid of the key mapping and go cold turkey.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the start, I made a lot of mistakes while inputting Vim commands
          and felt like I was coding much more slowly than before. Pairing was
          especially painful. It’s no fun to feel like you’re slowing down
          yourself <em>and</em> another person. In hindsight, though, I think I
          made a great decision! By the end of the week, I felt confident enough
          to start using Workman at work and haven’t looked back.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a side effect, I’m no longer able to touch-type QWERTY. At least I
          think that’s true: I haven’t tried for more than a minute or two. But
          I’m not unhappy about it. I can still type 65-70 wpm in a typing test.
          That’s 20-30 wpm slower than QWERTY, but it’s high enough that it
          doesn’t seem to have an impact on my programming speed. So much of
          coding is selecting the right option from the autocomplete dropdown
          anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do miss the extra speed when writing a blog post or messaging
          someone, though. I don’t quite feel like I type at the speed of
          thought (although I don’t think I ever did). But with daily real-world
          practice I expect to eventually reach a typing speed I’m happy with.
        </p>
        <p>
          I intended to title this post “Mastering Workman”, but I don't think
          I’ve reached mastery yet. Hopefully next time I report back I’ll feel
          that way!
