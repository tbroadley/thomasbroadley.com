        <p>
          Yesterday I participated in a discussion group over voice chat. It was
          the first time in a couple of months that I’d had a real conversation
          with people I hadn’t met before. Making more friends is a goal of
          mine, but I often feel prevented from achieving that goal by social
          anxiety. Yesterday was no exception. When I woke up in the morning, I
          was already thinking about bailing on the discussion group.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the past, I’ve found that doing fulfilling solo activities helps me
          counteract this anxiety. So yesterday morning I did yoga, meditated,
          went on a bike ride to a park, cooked lunch, and sang. Even after all
          that, I was still feeling anxious about ten minutes before the
          meeting. As the meeting started, I saw the list of people in the voice
          chat room and felt intimidated by its size. I nearly let myself bail
          on the discussion group.
        </p>

        <p>
          Luckily, I took the opportunity to practice mindfulness. I took some
          deep breaths, closed my eyes, and focused on how I was feeling
          physically. I immediately noticed that my anxiety had manifested as a
          pit in my stomach. I focused on that sensation as well as I could and
          after a couple of minutes it mostly went away. I felt much calmer and,
          after a couple more minutes, I was able to join the voice chat room.
          I’m so glad I did. The discussion group was the highlight of my week.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hope I’ll remember to use this technique more in the future. I think
          I can apply it not just to social anxiety but also my tendency to
          procrastinate.
