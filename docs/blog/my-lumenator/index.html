        <p>
          Even in Berkeley, we get less than ten hours of sunlight a day in
          January. I feel bleh when the sun sets at 5pm.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, last year, I built a lumenator! It's a string of 25 13-watt
          (100-watt-equivalent), 1,500-lumen lightbulbs hung from the top of my
          apartment walls using Command hooks. I put paper lanterns on the
          lights. They're aesthetic and, when I look directly at the lights by
          accident, they don't hurt my eyes.
        </p>
        <p>Look how dark my living room is compared to the lumenator!</p>

          My friend Jenn

            >recommended</a

          using a mix of 5000k (white) and 2700k (yellow) bulbs. The bulbs I
          bought claim to have a CRI (colour rendering index) of 90 or greater.
          I’m not sure. Compared to direct sunlight, colours seem muted under
          the lumenator.
        </p>
        <p>
          The setup cost 210.10 USD up-front and uses about 117 kWh/month (<code
            >25 bulbs * 13 W/bulb * 12 hours-in-use/day * 30 days/month</code
          >), which costs about $45/month in Berkeley.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn’t go for dimmable bulbs or a dimmer. Usually, I turn the
          lumenator on when the sun rises and leave it on until 8pm. Then, I
          wind down for bed.
        </p>
        <h2>Construction and installation</h2>
        <p>
          The first time I built and installed the lumenator, it took about
          three hours. A few months later, I uninstalled and disassembled it.
          That took about 90 minutes. Later still, reassembling and reinstalling
          the lumenator also took about three hours.
        </p>
        <p>Assembly and installation:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Go around the perimeter of the room, standing on a chair or ladder
            and applying the Command hooks. Use a tape measure to ensure the
            hooks are 14-16 inches apart.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use an Exacto knife to cut off some of the rubber around each of the
            sockets on the cord. Not all the rubber, just enough that you can
            screw in the bulbs. Or buy a different cord!
          </li>
          <li>Screw in the bulbs</li>
          <li>Unfold 25 paper lanterns</li>
          <li>
            Each socket is attached to a small cord, a few inches long, that
            hangs off the main cord. Thread each of the small cords through the
            top of a paper lantern
          </li>
          <li>
            After waiting an hour for the Command strips to set, go around the
            room on a chair or ladder again, hanging up each bulb + lantern by
            the hook on the end of its small cord
          </li>
          <li>Plug ‘er into the wall!</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>I’m happy to have my lumenator, but I wish it were brighter.</p>
        <p>
          The lumenator outputs a lot of lumens,
          <code>25 * 1,500 = 37,500</code> to be exact. But a lot of lumens do
          not a lot of lux make. (Lumens measure light output; lux measures
          light received at a particular distance.) Because I'm sitting three or
          four metres from the bulbs and the paper lanterns absorb a lot of the
          light, I only receive about 1,000 lux. This is the same as the light
          from the sun on a cloudy day (<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux#Illuminance"
            >Wikipedia</a
          >).
        </p>
        <p>
          (I measured lux with
          <a
            href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doggoapps.luxlight&#x26;hl=en_US"
            >this Android app</a
          >, which uses my phone’s light sensor. I checked the sensor’s
          calibration by measuring the lux of a bulb with known brightness at a
          fixed distance. Surprisingly, the calibration was almost perfect!)
        </p>
        <p>
          At night or on a cloudy day, the extra 1,000 lumens makes a big
          difference. On a sunny day, it’s still noticeable, and I like to have
          it on.

                  >This</a
                >
                is the first result on Amazon for “2500 lumen led bulb 5000k”.
                It’s a 23-watt bulb. Using 25 of these would increase the lumens
                and lux by 60% and the cost by 75%. The product page doesn’t say
                anything about CRI
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Adding a second lumenator
            <ul>
              <li>This would roughly double the lumens, lux, and cost</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Other experiments</h2>
        <p>
          Before building this lumenator, I played around with these
          <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C89JNFFG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1"
            >21,000-lumen lamps</a
          >. I hung one up at the juncture of a wall and the ceiling. These are
          bright and concentrated light sources. It feels easy to look directly
          at them and hurt my eyes.
