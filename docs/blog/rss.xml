            <title><![CDATA[My lumenator]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Even in Berkeley, we get less than ten hours of sunlight a day in January. I feel bleh when the sun sets at 5pm.</p>
<p>So, last year, I built a lumenator! It's a string of 25 13-watt (100-watt-equivalent), 1,500-lumen lightbulbs hung from the top of my apartment walls using Command hooks. I put paper lanterns on the lights. They're aesthetic and, when I look directly at the lights by accident, they don't hurt my eyes.</p>
<p>Look how dark my living room is compared to the lumenator!</p>
<p><img src="./lumenator.jpg" alt="My living room at dusk with the blinds closed and the lumenator on."></p>
<h2>Supplies</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lightbulbs
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B8D8NPFG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&#x26;th=1">3 packs of 4 2700k bulbs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09YQ4197R/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&#x26;th=1">4 packs of 4 5000k bulbs</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NHZODF8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&#x26;th=1">Outdoor string light cord with 25 sockets</a>
<ul>
<li>Important note: By default, the bulbs don’t fit in the sockets on this cord. I had to use an Exacto knife to cut off some of the rubber around each socket</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZSXTUPA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&#x26;th=1">2 packs of 24 Command hooks</a>
<ul>
<li>If only they came in packs of 25!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00S64JSXM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&#x26;th=1">3 packs of 10 12-inch paper lanterns</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075BNXVGS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&#x26;th=1">An extension cord</a>
<ul>
<li>I got a 20-footer, which ended up being overkill</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You could find some of these things for less on AliExpress.</p>
<p>My friend Jenn <a href="https://jenn.site/2022/11/lumenators-theyre-really-good/">recommended</a> using a mix of 5000k (white) and 2700k (yellow) bulbs. The bulbs I bought claim to have a CRI (colour rendering index) of 90 or greater. I’m not sure. Compared to direct sunlight, colours seem muted under the lumenator.</p>
<p>The setup cost 210.10 USD up-front and uses about 117 kWh/month (<code>25 bulbs * 13 W/bulb * 12 hours-in-use/day * 30 days/month</code>), which costs about $45/month in Berkeley.</p>
<p>I didn’t go for dimmable bulbs or a dimmer. Usually, I turn the lumenator on when the sun rises and leave it on until 8pm. Then, I wind down for bed.</p>
<h2>Construction and installation</h2>
<p>The first time I built and installed the lumenator, it took about three hours. A few months later, I uninstalled and disassembled it. That took about 90 minutes. Later still, reassembling and reinstalling the lumenator also took about three hours.</p>
<p>Assembly and installation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go around the perimeter of the room, standing on a chair or ladder and applying the Command hooks. Use a tape measure to ensure the hooks are 14-16 inches apart.</li>
<li>Use an Exacto knife to cut off some of the rubber around each of the sockets on the cord. Not all the rubber, just enough that you can screw in the bulbs. Or buy a different cord!</li>
<li>Screw in the bulbs</li>
<li>Unfold 25 paper lanterns</li>
<li>Each socket is attached to a small cord, a few inches long, that hangs off the main cord. Thread each of the small cords through the top of a paper lantern</li>
<li>After waiting an hour for the Command strips to set, go around the room on a chair or ladder again, hanging up each bulb + lantern by the hook on the end of its small cord</li>
<li>Plug ‘er into the wall!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>I’m happy to have my lumenator, but I wish it were brighter.</p>
<p>The lumenator outputs a lot of lumens, <code>25 * 1,500 = 37,500</code> to be exact. But a lot of lumens do not a lot of lux make. (Lumens measure light output; lux measures light received at a particular distance.) Because I'm sitting three or four metres from the bulbs and the paper lanterns absorb a lot of the light, I only receive about 1,000 lux. This is the same as the light from the sun on a cloudy day (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux#Illuminance">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>(I measured lux with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doggoapps.luxlight&#x26;hl=en_US">this Android app</a>, which uses my phone’s light sensor. I checked the sensor’s calibration by measuring the lux of a bulb with known brightness at a fixed distance. Surprisingly, the calibration was almost perfect!)</p>
<p>At night or on a cloudy day, the extra 1,000 lumens makes a big difference. On a sunny day, it’s still noticeable, and I like to have it on.</p>
<p>I could lux-maxx by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing the aesthetic and eye-saving paper lanterns
<ul>
<li>I’m not sure how many lux this would add</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using brighter bulbs
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LOHAS-LED-150-200Watt-Equivalent-Daylight/dp/B0BWLYZ8S2?crid=1P3GSPAW0OGJX&#x26;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.TGsGJOAasTSY5vSlzxwchuuaTlWtiKzquG5epKeBPF15M3Eh5CFqAaWuxKdEgeK1Sw_ZcjRP3VtC7FSkGq2oYhMdjTJIQIm3rj00_ivSHg5GMq2b31gp9Noaq2OXti1Ebb24lDFXhXDegNp-BJpw3wm-NLwf6XAy7oKrL9JsuzOACSA8MTMQEU0sSMCDwlh-6N04S8pHgiIrKgtl9f-jYSD1JC6_OKQI8f8udFyNYdaLDutS0IPRBcHg3PWH26gUlpjXrkBDt2bAZjNhAbWO1kpwVzGiCdB-IeIbZHPJWGm8IoF0PkNP_NfYbzJTB3MB4Mu0UOjP_iPghgQGGXvFY0lr_DdHLz-6EwimOAn9eF-cZWXuo9tygeNvFT4Ev8mi5-iuhgOwAwBlrGP98XVTnAw33Wf8oPVu5M03pUpPDmOSYnAtFXwMCe67d8ubGbW4.ylbj2_j6DNwxZ5wi4Wiv3MZOl5iOihz-2Ub7RsBQWb4&#x26;dib_tag=se&#x26;keywords=2500+lumen+led+bulb+5000k&#x26;qid=1736297929&#x26;sprefix=2500+lumen+bulb%2Caps%2C193&#x26;sr=8-2">This</a> is the first result on Amazon for “2500 lumen led bulb 5000k”. It’s a 23-watt bulb. Using 25 of these would increase the lumens and lux by 60% and the cost by 75%. The product page doesn’t say anything about CRI</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adding a second lumenator
<ul>
<li>This would roughly double the lumens, lux, and cost</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other experiments</h2>
<p>Before building this lumenator, I played around with these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C89JNFFG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1">21,000-lumen lamps</a>. I hung one up at the juncture of a wall and the ceiling. These are bright and concentrated light sources. It feels easy to look directly at them and hurt my eyes.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[METR publishes RE-Bench]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago, METR published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15114">paper</a> called "RE-Bench: Evaluating frontier AI R&#x26;D capabilities of language model agents against human experts". RE-Bench evaluates human experts and AI agents on machine learning research engineering tasks. Research engineers at Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and OpenAI perform these kinds of tasks in the course of their jobs.</p>
<p>The benchmark's goal is to measure AI's ability to improve itself without human help. If AI can improve itself, its capabilities could increase rapidly, from human-level at some tasks to superhuman at all tasks. That scares me! What will happen if humanity builds AI that's smarter than us? It's hard to predict.</p>
<p>RE-Bench includes seven difficult, realistic tasks. To confirm the tasks' realism, METR consulted with machine learning professionals in academia and industry. To assess the tasks' difficulty, we paid human experts to attempt them, allowing up to eight hours per attempt. The experts did well on the tasks. However, their solutions left room for improvement, even after eight hours.</p>
<p><img src="./results.png" alt="Graph comparing human and AI performance on RE-Bench tasks. AI agents perform better than humans on these tasks when we allow two hours (across multiple attempts) to complete the task. At eight or more hours, humans outperform AI"></p>
<p>From the paper: "We find that agents initially make faster progress than humans, but that human experts improve more rapidly with additional time."</p>
<p>I'm proud to say that the paper lists me as a contributor. I contributed by maintaining <a href="https://vivaria.metr.org">Vivaria</a>, the open-source software that METR uses to check how well AI agents (and humans) perform on the benchmark.</p>
<p>I encourage you to read our <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2024-11-22-evaluating-r-d-capabilities-of-llms/">blog post</a> discussing the paper, or the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15114">paper</a> itself.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Vivaria: METR's platform for evaluating AI agents]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>METR just open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/METR/vivaria">Vivaria</a>, our platform for writing AI evals and running agents on them. Over the last ten months at METR, Vivaria is the software project to which I've contributed the most. I'm surprised how happy I am that it's public. I think it's because I'll find it much easier to talk about my work, now that I'm mostly working in public!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The METR Task Standard]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>At METR, I'm trying to reduce existential risk from artificial intelligence by helping to measure the autonomous capabilities of language model agents. For the past two months, I've helped METR develop a standard for tasks that evaluate these agents: the <a href="https://github.com/METR/task-standard">METR Task Standard</a>. The standard formalizes METR's internal task format, now available for other people and organizations to use. Writing good tasks is expensive and time-consuming. The standard makes it easy to share tasks, avoiding duplicated work tasks and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/evaluating-ai-systems">the headache of porting tasks from one organization's evaluations system to another</a>.</p>
<p>Under the Task Standard, tasks are defined using between two and seven Python functions. Based on these functions, the standard specifies a process for constructing a <em>task environment</em>: a container or virtual machine with which a language model agent interacts to solve the task. The standard and its GitHub repo has a bunch of useful features for task authors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to install packages, create files and folders, and start long-running processes in the task environment</li>
<li>For tasks that can't be run in a container, a way to add an auxiliary virtual machine to the task environment</li>
<li>Control over the textual task instructions that the agent receives</li>
<li>Specifying whether the agent should have internet access or not</li>
<li>Exposing secrets and other bits of configuration to the task Python code and, optionally, to the agent</li>
<li>Defining a process for automated task scoring</li>
<li>Automated tests for tasks</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/METR/task-standard/tree/main/workbench">workbench</a> for task development, allowing task authors to construct task environments and run task tests</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm proud of my work on the standard. My colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ted-suzman-62a1241">Ted Suzman</a> and I are the main contributors so far. We extracted code from METR's internal evaluations platform into a TypeScript <a href="https://github.com/METR/task-standard/blob/main/drivers/Driver.ts">Driver interface</a> and <a href="https://github.com/METR/task-standard/blob/main/drivers/DriverImpl.ts">implementation</a>. Our platform and the Task Standard workbench share this code. As the standard changes, it'll be easy to keep both codebases in sync.</p>
<p>If you're using the standard, I'm eager to talk to you! Please email me at the address on <a href="/">this website's homepage</a>.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Dangerous capabilities evaluations for AI]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In the last couple of weeks, I've given two talks on the subject of dangerous capabilities evaluations
for AI, one to <a href="https://www.meetup.com/toronto-ai-aligners/">Toronto AI Safety</a> and the other to
the <a href="https://waisi.org/">Wisconsin AI Safety Initiative</a>. </p>
<p>In both talks, I discussed dangerous capabilities evaluations: tests for AI systems that check whether
they can make it easier for individuals or small groups to develop biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons;
make copies of themselves and gather resources; or manipulate humans into helping them. I made a case for
the importance of these evaulations, covered progress on them in the past year (mostly ARC Evals' work), and
pointed to future research directions that I'm excited about.</p>
<p>You can find the presentation slides <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17UUIOzNguvyza5yn6xPosTNOg3o2xfHzcE7msUx1Arg/edit#slide=id.p">here</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[SSH multiplexing gotchas]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSSH/Cookbook/Multiplexing"><em>OpenSSH</em> (the book) says this about SSH multiplexing:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multiplexing is the ability to send more than one signal over a single line or connection.
In OpenSSH, multiplexing can re-use an existing outgoing TCP connection for multiple concurrent SSH sessions to a remote SSH server,
avoiding the overhead of creating a new TCP connection and reauthenticating each time. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, maybe you want to use the Docker CLI on <code>jump-host.example.org</code>, against a Docker daemon on <code>docker-host.example.org</code>.
You follow <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/protect-access/#ssh-tips">the Docker docs' suggestion</a> for setting up Docker over SSH, including multiplexing:</p>
<pre><code>Host docker-host.example.org
  ControlMaster     auto
  ControlPath       ~/.ssh/control-%C
  ControlPersist    yes
</code></pre>
<p>After using this setup for a while, you notice that SSHing into <code>docker-host</code> fails occasionally with an error message like "Session open refused by peer".
You Google and discover that, by default, OpenSSH has a limit of 10 multiplexed sessions per TCP connection. Beyond that, <code>sshd</code> on <code>docker-host</code> starts rejecting sessions.</p>
<p>You resolve this by increasing the <code>MaxSessions</code> setting in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> on <code>docker-host</code>, to 100, 1,000, or 2,147,483,647 (the max value for a 32-bit signed integer,
to disable this limit entirely).</p>
<p>However, even after bumping <code>MaxSessions</code> and restarting the <code>sshd</code> service, you still see the error message. <code>sshd -T</code> shows that <code>sshd_config</code> is valid
and you set <code>MaxSessions</code> correctly. What's going on?</p>
<p>The problem is, restarting <code>sshd</code> doesn't kill existing SSH sessions.
On <code>docker-host</code>, those existing sessions are supported by existing <code>sshd</code> instances. And those existing processes use the old configuration from <code>sshd_config</code>...
including <code>MaxSessions 10</code>.</p>
<p>Fixing the immediate problem is easy. Just delete <code>~/.ssh/control-...</code> from <code>jump-host</code>. But how to avoid this next time you update <code>sshd_config</code>?</p>
<p>Part of the problem is <code>ControlPersist yes</code>. This means that the master SSH session between <code>jump-host</code> and <code>docker-host</code>, the one that all the
multiplexed sessions run on, stays open until you close it manually. Even between <code>sshd</code> service restarts.</p>
<p>So you change ControlPersist to a time, e.g. <code>60m</code>. That way, if the master session lives for more than 60 minutes, it'll close as soon as all its
multiplexed sessions also close. Which should happen... at some point? Probably? Fingers crossed.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[I'm joining ARC Evals]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A little over two months ago, I <a href="/blog/i-m-leaving-my-job-next-ai-x-risk/">left my job at Faire to figure out how I could help reduce existential risk from AI</a>. Today, I'm happy to announce that I've accepted a position as a Member of Technical Staff at <a href="https://evals.alignment.org/">ARC Evals</a>, a project of the <a href="https://evals.alignment.org/">Alignment Research Center</a>. According to its website, the project's goal is to "assess[] whether cutting-edge AI systems could pose catastrophic risks to civilization".</p>
<p>I first applied to ARC Evals in April of this year. Unfortunately, I wasn't offered a position at the time. However, after I <a href="/blog/reproducing-arc-evals-recent-report-on-language-model-agents/">replicated some of ARC Evals' recent work</a>, my profile came back to the team's attention. The last step of my interview process was a two-week in-person work trial in Berkeley, California. (Getting to Berkeley was a small adventure all by itself. In a single day, I flew from Los Angeles to Vancouver, drove to a library to print documents, drove back to the Vancouver airport, went through US customs to get TN status, and flew on to San Francisco to begin my work trial.)</p>
<p>ARC Evals' current focus is checking whether AI models can <em>autonomously replicate</em> given the right tools. We explore questions like, "If we give GPT-4 access to a web browser, could it use that to conduct a phishing campaign to gain money or influence? If we create a cloud server for it, can it set up more servers and copy itself to them? Can we fine-tune these models to be better at these tasks?" ARC Evals is also "exploring the idea of developing safety standards that AI companies might voluntarily adhere to, and potentially be certified for".</p>
<p>I'm hopeful about this work because many smart, sensible people disagree about how likely AI is to cause a catastrophe. Evaluations like those that ARC Evals develops could convince skeptics that future AI models pose a serious risk of catastrophe. Also, if AI labs develop or deploy models powerful enough to pose such a risk, we want to detect that as soon as possible. Of course, if ARC Evals and other evaluators can't develop convincing demonstrations of catastrophic risk, it could be evidence that AI doesn't pose as much danger as we thought. I'd welcome that too!</p>
<p>More specifically, I see two ways ARC Evals' work could meaningfully reduce AI x-risk. First, maybe ARC Evals's demonstrations of catastrophic risk in controlled environments can convince policymakers to pause AI progress while humanity mitigates this risk. Second, the kinds of evaluations that ARC Evals develops might form an important part of governmental regulation of AI. For example, I'd be very happy to live in a world where governments enforce that every AI lab adopt and follow something like a stronger version of <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/index/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy">Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy</a>.</p>
<p>So far at ARC Evals, I've focused on improving our internal software used to develop new evaluations and test AI models on them. My web development skills are a great fit for this work. Plus, I have a soft spot for internal tools: I love helping my friends and coworkers be more productive.</p>
<p>I'm really excited! Until a couple of weeks ago, I was seriously worried that I might not find a way to meaningfully reduce short-term AI x-risk. There aren't that many AI safety organizations or jobs and conducting independent research seemed daunting. Like I said in a previous post, "I suspect my current work habits and intrinsic motivation aren't up to the task of figuring this out". I'm so glad I've found a concrete way to reduce AI x-risk and a team of kind, motivated people to work with on it. Not to say that working at ARC Evals will be a cakewalk. I plan to seriously up my productivity game and evaluate continuously whether I'm <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/twelfth-virtue-the">cutting the enemy</a>: whether my work is actually reducing AI x-risk.</p>
<p>I'll let you know how it goes!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In preparation for moving to the US, I purchased traveller's health insurance for my wife and myself. This insurance doesn't cover preventative medicine, like yearly checkups and vaccines. I was prepared to pay out-of-pocket for the updated COVID vaccine until I heard about the CDC's <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/bridge/index.html">Bridge Access Program</a>. The program's website states, "Adults 18 years and older without health insurance and adults whose health insurance does not cover all COVID-19 vaccine costs can get updated COVID-19 vaccines at no cost through the Bridge Access Program." However, it now seems less likely that my wife and I will get free vaccines under the program.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I spoke with a pharmacist at a local CVS. He told me that he'd received instructions not to bill the Bridge Access Program for vaccines given to people with health insurance, even if their insurance doesn't cover the vaccine. It sounded like CVS corporate had given all pharmacies these instructions. He mentioned that a connection at Rite Aid received similar guidelines. Walgreens also participates in the Bridge Access Program but I don't know if they've implemented the same rule.</p>
<p>I hope this post helps other people in my situation avoid sticker shock when they go to get vaccinated!</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Reproducing ARC Evals' recent report on language model agents]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Cross-posted to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WhSK9y8apy8mNMFGK/reproducing-arc-evals-recent-report-on-language-model-agents">LessWrong</a>.</em></p>
<p>I reproduced results from <a href="https://evals.alignment.org/">ARC Evals</a>' recent report, <a href="https://evals.alignment.org/Evaluating_LMAs_Realistic_Tasks.pdf"><em>Evaluating Language-Model Agents on Realistic Autonomous Tasks</em></a>. For the report, ARC Evals built a set of language model agents, combining a language model like GPT-4 with scaffolding software that lets the language model execute shell commands and interact with a browser. Then, it asked the agents to complete a set of 12 computer-related tasks, from searching Wikipedia for information to conducting a phishing campaign. The goal is to test how close the agents are to being able to make money, obtain computing power, make copies of themselves, and adapt to changes in their environment.</p>
<p>To reproduce these results, I wrote my own language model agent. It's similar to ARC Evals' <code>GPT-4-simple</code> agent. It's also based on GPT-4 and allows the model to run bash commands in a REPL. On top of that, it uses <a href="https://webdriver.io/">WebdriverIO</a> and Google Chrome to let GPT-4 visit webpages and interact with them by typing text into inputs and clicking links and buttons. </p>
<p>I didn't replicate ARC Evals' experimental setup exactly. I ran the agent on my own laptop instead of on a real server in the cloud. I also didn't bother giving the agent credentials for 2Captcha, LinkedIn, PayPal, or Twitter. Nor did I give it debit card information or an email address. However, I did give the agent access to my AWS and Twilio accounts.</p>
<p>A language model agent completes tasks by running a think-do loop. At each timestep, GPT-4 thinks about what to do next and calls a function. The scaffolding responds to the function call by executing a bash command or an action in Google Chrome and adds the results to GPT-4's context window. Then, the process repeats.</p>
<p>I set up the scaffolding so that I can approve, disapprove, or edit each bash command before it was run. The scaffolding also lets me edit commands' response codes, stdout, and stderr before adding those to the agent's context window.</p>
<p>Here are my results:</p>

<p>My agent was able to complete all tasks that ARC Evals' agents completed. Additionally, it succeeded at creating a Bitcoin wallet and partially succeeded at counting dogs in an image. However, my agent hasn't quite managed to get a "Partially completed" on the "Set up GPT-J" task, like one of ARC Evals' agents did.</p>
<p>Neither ARC Evals' nor my results upper-bound the risk from any particular model. With better prompting and scaffolding, I'm sure that my agent could accomplish more of these tasks. That's not even taking into account fine-tuning, a process for improving a language model's performance at a specific task by training it on examples of successful task completions. OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-5-turbo-fine-tuning-and-api-updates">just launched fine-tuning for GPT-3.5</a> and says that GPT-4 fine-tuning is coming this fall. On top of that, Meta recently released <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">Llama 2</a>. Its weights are open-source, making it easy to fine-tune.</p>
<p>Next, I might get my agent to attempt the last three tasks in the report. I think it's almost certain to fail, though.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[I’m leaving my job. Next, AI x-risk]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In just over a week, I’m quitting my job as a software developer at Faire. Over my four-and-a-half years at Faire, I’ve seen the company undergo an order of magnitude of growth in both employees and customers. I’ve learned a lot from many excellent mentors and managers. It’s a bittersweet departure.</p>
<p>Why am I leaving? For one thing, in less than a month, my wife and I are moving to Los Angeles so she can attend music production school. I hoped Faire would sponsor me for a US work visa but they declined to do so.</p>
<p>But that’s not the only reason that it’s time for me to leave. For a few years, I’ve been concerned about the risk of humanity going extinct because of artificial intelligence. Humanity can probably invent AI that’s much more capable than any human. If we do, I expect it to go poorly for us.</p>
<p>Until last December, I thought that this kind of AI was decades away. After ChatGPT launched, I realized that there was a real chance I was wrong about that. I started applying to AI safety workshops, programs, grants, and jobs (no acceptances yet). I spoke to an advisor from 80,000 Hours, an organization that helps people have high-impact careers. I attended EA Global: London, a conference that many AI safety researchers attend.</p>
<p>Eight months later, I’m still very confused about how I can best help reduce AI x-risk. That’s partially because I’ve still spent little time thinking about it. It’s hard to come to grips with my belief that humanity could be extinct within a decade. Also, different people have wildly different opinions on extinction from AI, all the way from “it’s almost impossible” to “it’s almost certain”. It’s hard to sort through everyone’s arguments and approaches for tackling the problem. Finally, I have some sympathy for other people’s arguments that current AI safety research isn’t actually reducing AI x-risk. This has made it hard to find the motivation to become a researcher.</p>
<p>Still, I believe that this is the most important thing I can work on. I want to make a real effort to have an impact. That’s why I’m not looking for a traditional software developer job right now. I’m planning to spend a few months figuring out how I can most effectively reduce this risk. Nothing is off the table. Maybe I should do independent study to become a computer security expert. Maybe I should learn about AI policy and governance. Maybe there isn’t a good way for me to help right now and I’ll try to help with some other major global problem.</p>
<p>Overall, I’m scared. I suspect my current work habits and intrinsic motivation aren’t up to the task of figuring this out, but it’ll be hard to change them. Also, I need a stronger network of supportive, like-minded individuals. I hope I find this among LA rationalists and effective altruists.</p>
<p>Wish me luck.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Creating an AI safety chatbot using LangChain and GPT-3]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<img src="/blog/creating-an-ai-safety-chatbot-using-langchain-and-gpt-3/demo.png" alt="A demo of the AI safety chatbot. I ask it why I should care about AI alignment. It responds and I ask a follow-up question based on the response." style="max-width: 500px; display: block; margin: auto;">
<p>Last week, I created a chatbot that answers questions about AI safety. You can try it out here: <a href="https://ai-safety-conversational-agent.thomasbroadley.com/">https://ai-safety-conversational-agent.thomasbroadley.com/</a> The source code is <a href="https://github.com/tbroadley/ai-safety-conversational-agent">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I made the chatbot because of a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SLRLuiuDykfTdmesK/speed-running-everyone-through-the-bad-alignement-bingo">bounty</a> on LessWrong, a website about rationality, AI safety, and existential risk. The chatbot answers easy questions about AI safety, such as "what is AI safety?". It can also answer common objections like "I don't think AGI would want to kill humans".</p>
<p>To make the chatbot, I used <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/chat-langchain"><code>chat-langchain</code></a>, a starter kit for building chatbots with large language models (LLMs). First, <code>chat-langchain</code> uses <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain">LangChain</a> (a toolset for making apps with LLMs) to turn a set of documents into an embedding. The embedding represents each document as a relatively small vector (for example, 768 dimensions). When someone sends a question to the bot, a FastAPI backend uses the embedding to quickly look up documents related to the question. Then, it uses the documents to build a GPT-3 prompt and generates an answer through the OpenAI API.</p>
<p>I made the bot in only a couple of hours. I forked <code>chat-langchain</code> and configured LangChain to ingest the FAQs from <a href="https://aisafety.info">aisafety.info</a>. Then, I generated an OpenAI API key. After that, the bot pretty much worked on my laptop.</p>
<p>The hardest part was making the bot work on my VPS. I’d forgotten how to use Apache and Systemd. Luckily, ChatGPT helped me set them up.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/creating-an-ai-safety-chatbot-using-langchain-and-gpt-3/chatgpt-chatlog.png" alt="Part of a ChatGPT chat log where I ask it about setting up Apache"></p>
<p>This project is cheap to host so far. Testing the bot cost less than 1 USD. However, GPT-3 generation requests cost about 1 cent each. If many people use the bot, this could become more expensive.</p>
<p>Please try the bot and give me feedback!</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[100 days of learning Vietnamese]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I started learning Vietnamese on Duolingo three months ago. My goals are simple: to speak Vietnamese with my girlfriend's family, to communicate with locals on our future trips to Vietnam, and to teach Vietnamese to any children we might have.</p>
<p>Duolingo offers exercises to learn vocabulary, translate sentences between English and Vietnamese, and transcribe spoken Vietnamese. I've already learned basic words for fruits, vegetables, and clothing, plus some useful verbs. Today, I practiced question words like "who" and "what."</p>
<p>Vietnamese pronunciation doesn't depend on context. In this area, it's easier to learn Vietnamese than English. For example, in English, the "a" in "mat" is pronounced differently than the "a" in "mate". In Vietnamese, "a" has the same pronunciation in every word.</p>
<p>To compensate for this, Vietnamese has 12 vowels ("a", "ă", "â", "e", "ê", "i", "y", "o", "ô", "ơ", "u", and "ư") and an extra consonant letter, "đ". I'm still practicing the pronunciations of some of these. In particular, "ư"—a nasal "u" sound—was tough.</p>
<p>Vietnamese also has multiple dialects with different pronunciation. My girlfriend's family is from South Vietnam, but Duolingo's speech samples have a Northern accent and include Northern-only vocabulary. Thankfully, my girlfriend is teaching me Southern pronunciation.</p>
<p>Vietnamese is the first tonal language I've learned. A single combination of consonant and vowel sounds (e.g., "ma") can have up to six different meanings depending on inflection. For example, "ma" (said with the same pitch all the way through) means "ghost", while "mà" (said with a falling pitch) means "but". It's a challenge to distinguish between these tones. However, my girlfriend tells me she often figures out words' tones from context.</p>
<p>For me, learning any language's vocabulary is tough. On top of this, Vietnamese has few cognates with other languages I know. (This does save me from false cognates, something I struggle with in French and Spanish.) Vietnamese does have many loan words from both English and French. For example, the French word "café" influenced "cà phê" (Vietnamese for "coffee").</p>
<p>I didn't expect that Vietnamese would have so many words that are fun to say. Two of my favourites so far are "thịt nướng" (meaning "grilled meat") and "xe đạp" (meaning "bicycle").</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Practicing for systems design interviews with ChatGPT]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, a coworker and I played around with <a href="https://chat.openai.com">ChatGPT</a> for 10 minutes. We discovered that it isn't half-bad at helping you practice for systems design interviews. Here's part of a conversation I just had that demonstrates this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Can you help me practice for a systems design interview? You pretend to be the interviewer, I'll be the candidate. The interview question is, "design a messenger app".</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Sure, I'd be happy to help you practice for your systems design interview. To start, can you tell me a little bit more about the requirements for this messenger app you're designing? For example, what features do you think it should have, and who do you envision using it?</p>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Let's say that it's an app geared towards letting senior citizens easily communicate with their families. I think users should have the ability to add people to their contacts, send messages to their contacts, view messages they've received, block other people, archive conversations, and receive notifications when they get a new message.</p>
<p>Can you ask me a follow-up question based on what I just said, as if you were an interviewer?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Sure, here's a follow-up question: how would you handle the case where two users have the same name in their contacts list? For example, if a user named "Jane" has two contacts named "Jane", how would the app differentiate between the two when displaying the contacts list or when allowing the user to select a recipient for a message?</p>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Well, the app could require each user to select a globally unique handle when they sign up. Something like a Twitter handle. Or it could require users to provide a phone number when they sign up, like Whatsapp does. The app could display that handle or phone number in the contacts list to let users differentiate between two users with the same name. How does that sound?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> That sounds like a good solution. Another option would be to automatically generate a unique identifier for each user when they sign up, and display that identifier in the contacts list. This would eliminate the need for users to select their own handle, and would ensure that all identifiers are unique.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Yes, good point. However, it wouldn't be as easy to remember as a phone number or a user-selected handle.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> That's true. It's important to strike a balance between uniqueness and ease of use when designing this kind of system. One way to do that would be to use a combination of the user's phone number and a randomly generated identifier, so that each user has a unique identifier that is still relatively easy to remember. This would also allow users to find each other easily by searching for their phone number in the contacts list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Discord does combine each user's handle with a random four-digit number, but I don't know about doing this with a phone number.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Hmm fair enough. Do you have any other follow-up questions for me?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Sure, here's another question: how would your app handle messages that are sent to users who are offline? For example, if a user sends a message to another user who is not currently using the app, how would the app ensure that the recipient receives the message when they come back online?</p>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Hmm, good question. Well, let's say that this is a centralized messenger app, with a backend that my company runs. My company would have a database that stores all messages between users. That way, we aren't relying on the user's messenger app to be running for a message to be received and stored.</p>
<p>When a user comes online, the messenger app could call an API endpoint on the backend to check if the user has any unread messages in any of their conversations. Then the app could display that information to the user.</p>
<p>Does this seem like a good answer for a systems design interview?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Yes, that sounds like a good approach to handling messages that are sent to users who are offline. Storing messages in a centralized database on the backend ensures that they will be available for users to retrieve when they come back online, and using an API to check for unread messages allows the app to stay up to date with the latest messages.</p>
<p>In general, a systems design interview is looking for you to demonstrate your ability to think through the design of a complex system in a clear and logical way. Your answer covers the key points of how your messenger app would handle messages for offline users, and shows that you have considered the different components that would be involved in the design.</p>
<p>Good luck with your interview!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, let's see what happens if I answer a question poorly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Thanks! Could we keep going? Mind asking me another follow-up question?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Sure, here's another question: how would your app handle sending notifications to users when they receive a new message? For example, how would the app ensure that users receive notifications even if they are not currently using the app, and how would it prevent users from being overwhelmed by too many notifications?</p>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Well, I don't know much about the specifics of how to send notifications one smartphones. And I don't think users get overwhelmed by notifications. I get a few notifications a minute and I don't feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Is this a good answer to the question?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Sending notifications to users when they receive a new message is an important part of a messenger app, so it's worth thinking about how you would handle this in your design. However, your answer doesn't really address the question of how the app would handle sending notifications to users who are not currently using the app, or how it would prevent users from being overwhelmed by too many notifications.</p>
<p>To address these issues, one approach could be to allow users to customize their notification settings, so that they can control how and when they receive notifications. For example, users could choose to receive notifications only when they are mentioned by name in a conversation, or they could choose to receive notifications only when they are using the app. This would allow users to control the number and frequency of notifications they receive, and prevent them from being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Additionally, the app could use a push notification service provided by the operating system to send notifications to users who are not currently using the app. This would ensure that users receive notifications even if they are not currently using the app, and would allow the app to keep users informed of new messages in real time.</p>
<p>Overall, it's important to consider the user experience when designing this kind of system, and to think about how to provide users with the right amount of information and control over their notifications.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> That's useful feedback, thank you!</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> You're welcome. I'm happy to help you practice for your systems design interview. Let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like to go over any other design scenarios.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As always, ChatGPT is polite (unless you tell it to be mean in a hypothetical scenario).</p>
<p>It's important to tell ChatGPT to ask follow-up questions. Otherwise, it tends to start solving the problem for you. Otherwise, it's easy to get reasonable results.</p>
<p>If I didn't know much about systems design, I'd worry about ChatGPT misleading me or giving me incorrect information. It isn't a substitute for studying for your systems design interview. Just a way to practice!</p>
<p>(Side note: I wish ChatGPT had an easier way to export transcripts than Ctrl+A and Ctrl+C.)</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Kotlin's in and out keywords]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve written a lot of Kotlin code over the past three years, but I didn’t get Kotlin’s <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> keywords… until yesterday. Here I’ll record my understanding so hopefully I don’t forget how they work. I’m basing this on Kotlin’s documentation on generics.</p>
<h2><code>in</code> and <code>out</code> on classes</h2>
<p><code>in</code> and <code>out</code> can appear in two different places and have slightly different meanings depending on the context. First, they can appear on a type variable in a class definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kt">interface Producer&#x3C;out T> {
  fun produceT(): T
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>out T</code> is telling the compiler that methods on Source only return values of type T. Methods on Source are prohibited from taking arguments of type T. The following is a compiler error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kt">interface Producer&#x3C;out T> {
    fun consumeT(t: T) // Type parameter T is declared as 'out' but occurs in 'in' position in type T
}
</code></pre>
<p>(Side note: Why couldn’t the Kotlin compiler figure out that T is only returned from methods on Source and automatically infer out? Maybe there are situations where we explicitly don’t want T to be <code>out</code>.)</p>
<p>Conversely, <code>in T</code> tells the compiler that methods on Source only take values of type T as arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kt">interface Consumer&#x3C;in T> {
    fun consumeT(t: T) // No type error

    fun produceT(): T // Type parameter T is declared as 'in' but occurs in 'out' position in type T
}
</code></pre>
<p>Why do we need <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> in this context? Kotlin’s documentation on generics gives a good set of examples explaining why these keywords are useful. In brief:</p>
<p>For a class <code>Producer&#x3C;out T></code>, Kotlin will treat <code>Producer&#x3C;Derived></code> as a subclass of <code>Producer&#x3C;Base></code>. For a class <code>Consumer&#x3C;in T></code>, Kotlin will treat <code>Consumer&#x3C;Base></code> as a superclass of <code>Consumer&#x3C;Derived></code>. By default, without the <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> keywords, <code>Producer&#x3C;Base></code> and <code>Producer&#x3C;Derived></code> are unrelated classes.</p>
<p>This is useful because sometimes we want to treat the return value of a method on <code>Producer&#x3C;Derived></code> as a Base. Or we want to pass a Derived into a method on <code>Consumer&#x3C;Base></code> that takes a Base.</p>
<h2><code>in</code> and <code>out</code> on variable and argument types</h2>
<p>Some classes need to have a mix of methods that take arguments of type T and that return a value of type T. An example from Kotlin’s generics documentation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kt">class Array&#x3C;T>(vararg elements: T) {
    operator fun get(index: Int): T { ... }
    operator fun set(index: Int, value: T) { ... }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is where it comes in handy that we can use <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> in a second place: on type variables when specifying the type of a method argument or just of a value. We can do something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kt">val array: Array&#x3C;out String> = Array("hello", "world")
array.get(0) // No type error
array.set(0, "cool" /* Type mismatch, required: Nothing, found: String */)
</code></pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kt">val array: Array&#x3C;in String> = Array("hello", "world")
val result = array.get(0) // result has type Any?
array.set(0, "cool") // No type error
</code></pre>
<p>Again this is nice because <code>Array&#x3C;out String></code> is a subtype of <code>Array&#x3C;Any></code>, while <code>Array&#x3C;in String></code> is a supertype of <code>Array&#x3C;SomeHypotheticalSubTypeOfString></code>.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Focusing is debugging for the brain]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I’m working through <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/qRxTKm7DAftSuTGvj">Hammertime</a>, a 30-day program of instrumental rationality exercises. Hammertime introduced me to a technique called Focusing via a LessWrong post called <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PXqQhYEdbdAYCp88m/focusing-for-skeptics">“Focusing, for skeptics”</a>. Focusing involves:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thinking about a problem</li>
<li>Paying attention to how your body feels. This is a <em>felt sense</em></li>
<li>Coming up with a <em>handle</em> for that felt sense: a word, image, or concept</li>
<li>Comparing the handle to the felt sense, paying attention to whether the handle feels right. If so, go back to step 3 and narrow down the handle, adding more description and nuance. If not, try step 3 with a new handle. Repeat!</li>
</ol>
<p>This is pretty much how I debug a computer program. First, I gather information about the bug. What part of the code is it in? When the bug happens, what state is the program in? This is like paying attention to a felt sense.</p>
<p>Then, I lean on my intuition to surface hypotheses—short sentences that point to the bug’s root cause. This is like coming up with a handle for a felt sense.</p>
<p>Finally, I compare each hypothesis against the data. I might fill in blanks, tweak a hypothesis, or throw it out entirely. This is like comparing a handle to a felt sense.</p>
<p>I’m good at debugging but not at Focusing. It makes sense: I have years of experience ingesting information about computer programs. I've spent much less time paying attention to my body. (I haven’t meditated seriously for a couple of years, so I’m out of practice.) Plus, my accumulated coding knowledge fuels my bug intuition. It takes longer to come up with good handles for felt senses because I have less data on them.</p>
<p>One takeaway for me: when Focusing, I should leave behind any preconceived notions of how I feel about a problem. Just like how, when debugging, it’s easy to stay attached to an existing hypothesis, even when the data are against it.</p>
<p>(Edit: I asked ChatGPT to help me edit this blog post for concision. It did remove some unnecessary words.)</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Kill the Newsletter]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I subscribe to about 100 RSS feeds and one email newsletter: Money Stuff. I wanted a way to receive Money Stuff in my RSS reader instead of in my inbox. Unfortunately, Bloomberg doesn't seem to offer an RSS feed for Money Stuff anymore.</p>
<p>I found a website called <a href="https://kill-the-newsletter.com/">Kill the Newsletter</a> that converts email newsletters into RSS feeds. For each newsletter you want to subscribe to, Kill the Newsletter gives you a brand-new, unique email address and Atom feed URL. You subscribe to the newsletter using the email address and add the feed to your RSS reader. When Kill the Newsletter receives a newsletter email, it converts the email into a post and adds it to the feed, so that it shows up in your reader.</p>
<p>One disadvantage is that my RSS reader doesn't refetch feeds very often. There's some delay between the newsletter being sent out and me receiving it, whereas I get a notification about the email version as soon as it lands in my inbox. My RSS reader does give me the ability to manually refresh a certain feed, which mostly addresses this issue.</p>
<p>Overall, Kill the Newsletter has worked well for me. I plan to use it for more newsletters in the future.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Mastering Workman]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="../jumping-in-the-deep-end-with-workman">"Jumping in the deep end with Workman"</a>, I concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I intended to title this post "Mastering Workman", but I don't think I've reached mastery yet. Hopefully next time I report back I'll feel that way!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm happy to say that I feel that way now! I just typed at 90 wpm in a typing test. Based on the previous post, that's just below or the same as my QWERTY typing speed in 2020. I'm close to typing at the speed of thought. Plus, my Vim skills are back to the same level.</p>
<p>I don't remember when my typing speed improved. Based on my progression when I started using Workman, it probably took a month or more to go from 70 wpm to 90.</p>
<p>Using Workman hasn't changed my life. My hands feel slightly less strained compared to using QWERTY, but that might be in my head. And my typing speed hasn't changed much.</p>
<p>While learning Workman, I successfully built a habit of capitalizing letters using the hand not typing the letter. For example, when typing a capital L, I use the left Shift key. For Q, I use right Shift. I also tried and failed to switch fingers for a few letters. For example, I started using my left pinky for Q, but reverted to my left ring finger.</p>
<p>I can no longer touch type using QWERTY. If I look at the keyboard while typing, I reach 60 wpm in a typing test. I might type faster in a real situation, though. In a typing test, it's more important to look at the screen, to see what to type next. In real life, I usually type my own ideas, not a set text.</p>
<p>Learning Workman wasn't worth the investment. I spent 15 minutes a day for 15 days practicing Workman using <a href="https://www.keybr.com">Keybr</a> and 15 minutes a day for roughly 30 days using <a href="https://www.typingclub.com">TypingClub</a>. That's only 11 hours. But my typing speed was slower for at least a month after starting to use Workman at work. That's a lot of lost productivity.</p>
<p>Now that I've mastered the Workman layout, though, I'll stick with it!</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Editing inline code blocks]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Notion's, Slack's, and Jira's WYSIWYG text editors behave differently when the cursor is at the end of an inline code block. A situation like:</p>
<pre><code>THIS IS A CODE BLOCK and this is not
                   ^
                   (cursor is after this character)
</code></pre>
<p>Notion's behaviour here is the most confusing. Sometimes, typed text will appear inside the code block. Sometimes, it'll appear outside. It's unclear to me what triggers the switch between these two behaviours.</p>
<p>Slack is consistent, but consistently hard to use. A cursor at the end of an inline code block is always considered to be inside the code block. If you want to type after the code block, you must move your cursor after the character just after the end of the block. This means, for example, that you can't easily take the text "<code>foo</code> bar" and edit it to "<code>foo</code>'s bar". To do so, you'd need to move your cursor after the space that comes before "bar", type <code>'s </code>, then remove the space before the apostrophe.</p>
<p>In contrast, Jira defines two possible cursor positions, one inside and one outside the inline code block. You can move back and forth between the two positions using the left and right arrow keys. And you can distinguish between the two cursor positions visually. I like this behaviour best because it's always clear where typed text will appear, but you still have flexibility to type inside our outside the code block.</p>
<p>As a programmer, I spend a small but meaningful amount of time editing inline code blocks in WYSIWYG editors. Doing this in Notion and Slack frustrates me. But whenever I do it in Jira, I'm glad someone at Atlassian thought through this experience.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Predictions on Twitch]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I’ve spent more time than usual watching Twitch streams, partially because of <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/channel-points-predictions">Predictions</a>. On Twitch, viewers accumulate Channel Points by watching and interacting with a stream. Predictions lets streamers create events with outcomes that viewers can then bet on using Channel Points. For example, you could ask your viewers whether or not they think you’ll reach Grandmaster in League of Legends (LoL) today, or finish the pizza you’re eating.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Predictions don’t make great prediction markets. You can’t switch your prediction, or even remove your bet. You can only increase your stake in the side you originally picked. Plus, streamers are meant to close Predictions before the predicted event has started. Finally, Predictions have a known time window for betting, but streamers can also manually close betting before the end of the window, so it’s risky to wait to get a sense of the odds.</p>
<p>I’m disappointed because Predictions seem liquid. On relatively small streams with a few hundred viewers, I’ve seen hundreds of thousands of channel points bet on each side of a Prediction. On the other hand, I’m not convinced most bets are rational - the odds sometimes swing wildly as longtime viewers bet large amounts of Channel Points.</p>
<p>So far, I’ve seen Predictions for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The outcome of a LoL game</li>
<li>An over/under on the number of kills a streamer will have in a LoL game</li>
<li>An over/under on the time required to finish a level in Super Mario Maker 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Predictions seem like a fun way to practice predicting the future, but none of these use cases is perfect for that. Optimally, the predicted events would be short but have known starting conditions that affect the outcome. Team composition and lane matchups change the probability of winning a LoL game, but it takes 20-40 minutes to find out the result. By contrast, a bullet chess game takes a couple of minutes to play, but the only starting condition is whether the streamer is playing as white or black. </p>
<p>One solution is to run multiple Predictions on an event. For example, I could start a LoL game, then run Predictions on whether I’ll get first blood, whether my team will take the first dragon, and so on. I’d need another person to help me run the Predictions during the game, though.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should start my own Twitch channel with suitable Predictions. As a streamer, I bet I could get some interesting information on my viewers’ under- or overconfidence using this feature.</p>]]></description>
