      <section>
        <p>
          Recently I’ve been learning how to type using the
          <a href="https://workmanlayout.org/">Workman keyboard layout</a>. I’ve
          heard many times that QWERTY isn’t very ergonomic. I decided to learn
          a new keyboard layout to see how it’d affect my typing speed,
          accuracy, and comfort, and because it seemed like an interesting
          challenge. I must admit I didn’t do much research into the other
          alternative layouts. Basically, Workman’s excellent website convinced
          me to try it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve been practicing around 15 minutes a day for the past two weeks.
          I’ve considered practicing more, but honestly I don’t find the process
          that fun. Plus, I already spend a lot of time typing, using my phone,
          and playing the piano and bass, so I don’t want to put too much more
          strain on my hands.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m using <a href="https://keybr.com">Keybr</a> to learn Workman. It
          teaches you to type using many short lessons, 20 or 25 words each by
          default, composed of a randomly-generated mix of real and fake words.
          The fake words are either short, English-like sequences of letters or
          portmanteaus of two real words. You learn one letter at a time, only
          moving onto the next letter once you’ve mastered the current one.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started using Keybr to improve my QWERTY typing but found it
          annoying to use. I think that’s because I have word-level muscle
          memory for that keyboard layout. The fake words threw me off because
          they didn't exist in my muscle memory.
        </p>

        <p>
          Keybr works well for learning a new keyboard layout, though. Because
          of the fake words, the lessons don’t force you to type any one word
          too often, but are still full of common sequences of two to four keys
          containing the letter you’re currently learning. My hypothesis is that
          word-level muscle memory is built on top of muscle memory for these
          sequences. While learning a new key, I first gain muscle memory for
          the sequences enabled by introducing that key. For example, I learned
          I and N before learning G, so the lessons only included words ending
          in “ing” once I started learning G. Besides these sequences, I also
          build muscle memory for words of four letters or fewer that contain
          the new key. I then develop muscle memory for longer words. I looked
          for studies on motor learning that agreed or disagreed with this
          observation but couldn’t find any.
        </p>

        <p>
          I noticed a couple of factors that made a given key easier or more
          difficult to learn. It’s easy to analyze them using this graph from my
          Keybr profile:
        </p>

        <p class="image">
          <img
            alt="A graph from my Keybr profile. The x-axis is the typing lesson number, from 1 to 307. Each key has a row on the y-axis, sorted vertically by the lesson I started learning it. Each intersection of a lesson and a key contains a small rectangle, ranging from red for low speed and accuracy to green for high speed and accuracy (or white if I didn't practice that key in that lesson)."
            src="./keybr-graph.png"
          />
        </p>

        <p>
          The graph’s x-axis is the typing lesson number. You can see I’ve done
          307 Workman lessons so far. Red sections represent lessons with lower
          speed and accuracy for that key, while green indicates higher speed
          and accuracy.
        </p>

        <p>
          I found it easy to learn letters that Workman and QWERTY assigned to
          the same key. Unfortunately, only three of the letter keys I've
          learned so far are in the same location: A, S, and G. The graph above
          demonstrates that I quickly learned A and S and haven’t lost that
          proficiency since. G has been more challenging, perhaps because it
          doesn’t appear in every lesson.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was also easier to learn letters that only showed up in short
          words. For example, in my first lessons for K, the letter appeared
          almost exclusively in three- or four-letter words like “take” and
          “ack”. According to the graph, it only took me a few lessons to learn
          K initially. However, when a later lesson reintroduced it in a longer
          word, I struggled to remember it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, learning certain keys completely threw off my muscle memory
          for the keys I’d already learned. It was like my brain had to break
          down and restructure my existing muscle memory to take into account
          the new key.
        </p>

        <p>
          Take the R key as an example. It was one of the first six keys I
          learned. It only took me a few lessons to master it. However, my speed
          and accuracy for R have fallen several times while learning other keys
          (e.g. A and M). I’ve gone through a similar process of gaining and
          losing muscle memory with other keys, most dramatically D, H, and B.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s frustrating to get less proficient at a key. I wonder whether it
          would have been faster to learn how to type all the keys at once
          instead of one at a time. I think I would have abandoned the process
          because of the steeper learning curve, though.
        </p>

        <p>
          So far, I’ve learned all the letter keys except for Z, X, Q, and J.
          After learning those, to help me build word-level muscle memory, I
          might switch from Keybr to a different typing practice tool that
          emphasizes typing real words and sentences. I might practice with
          <a href="https://github.com/tbroadley/gpt-2-github">a tool</a> I
          developed that uses GPT-2 to generate typing lessons based on a GitHub
          user’s PR comments. The goal of this project is to let me practice
          typing text that’s as similar to the text I’m typing on a daily basis
          as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ll also try out Workman at work and in my personal life. I found it
          easy to install the layout on Mac OS by following the instructions
          <a href="https://github.com/workman-layout/Workman/tree/master/mac"
            >here</a
          >. Ubuntu is more challenging. The GitHub repository I just linked to
          contains instructions for four different ways to enable Workman on
          Ubuntu. I don’t run <code>xfree86</code>, so that method isn’t an
          option. The <code>linux_console</code> and
          <code>xorg</code> approaches don’t work on my computer—I think they
          might only work on an older version of Ubuntu. The
          <code>xmodmap</code> approach enables Workman in Firefox but not in my
          terminal. I’ll have to keep investigating.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ll write another post once I’ve determined if Workman helps me type
          faster, more accurately, or with less effort. Even if I go back to
          QWERTY, learning Workman has already paid dividends: The process has
          improved my QWERTY typing. I’ve started using the “correct” fingers on
          more distant keys. For example, I now use my right ring finger to type
          O and P, instead of my middle finger. I’m not sure how to quantify the
          impact of this, but I think it’ll slightly reduce the strain of
          typing.
