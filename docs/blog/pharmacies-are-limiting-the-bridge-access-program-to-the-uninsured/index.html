          In preparation for moving to the US, I purchased traveller's health
          insurance for my wife and myself. This insurance doesn't cover
          preventative medicine, like yearly checkups and vaccines. I was
          prepared to pay out-of-pocket for the updated COVID vaccine until I
          heard about the CDC's
          <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/bridge/index.html"
            >Bridge Access Program</a
          >. The program's website states, "Adults 18 years and older without
          health insurance and adults whose health insurance does not cover all
          COVID-19 vaccine costs can get updated COVID-19 vaccines at no cost
          through the Bridge Access Program." However, it now seems less likely
          that my wife and I will get free vaccines under the program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yesterday, I spoke with a pharmacist at a local CVS. He told me that
          he'd received instructions not to bill the Bridge Access Program for
          vaccines given to people with health insurance, even if their
          insurance doesn't cover the vaccine. It sounded like CVS corporate had
          given all pharmacies these instructions. He mentioned that a
          connection at Rite Aid received similar guidelines. Walgreens also
          participates in the Bridge Access Program but I don't know if they've
          implemented the same rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope this post helps other people in my situation avoid sticker
          shock when they go to get vaccinated!
