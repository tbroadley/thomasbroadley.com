          To do I/O in Java, you read from InputStreams and write to
          OutputStreams. Sometimes you want to connect the output of an
          OutputStream to the input of an InputStream. In my case, I wanted to
          upload a CSV (generated by writing to a given OutputStream) to Amazon
          S3 (using a class reading from an InputStream).
        </p>

        <p>
          I solved this problem using a
          <a
            href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PipedInputStream.html"
            >PipedInputStream</a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PipedOutputStream.html"
            >PipedOutputStream</a
          >. Reading from a PipedInputStream returns bytes written to the
          connected PipedOutputStream. Here was the Kotlin code I ended up with:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-kotlin">// Create a PipedInputStream; automatically close it at the end of
// the lambda
PipedInputStream().use { inputStream ->

  // Run the given lambda in a new thread
  thread {

    // Create a PipedOutputStream and connect it to the
    // PipedInputStream; automatically close it at the end of the
    // lambda
    PipedOutputStream(inputStream).use { outputStream ->
      generateCsv(outputStream)
    }
  }

  uploadToS3(inputStream)
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          These classes come with a couple of gotchas. First, you should write
          to the PipedOutputStream and read from the PipedInputStream on
          separate threads. (Each class’s documentation clearly states this, so
          this isn’t so much a gotcha as a case of me not reading the docs
          closely enough.) If you read and write on the same thread, you might
          encounter a deadlock.
        </p>

        <p>
          The deadlock’s symptoms depend on whether your single-threaded code
          reads before it writes or vice versa. If it reads from the
          PipedInputStream first, it’ll hang forever waiting for something to
          write to the PipedOutputStream. However, if it writes to the
          PipedOutputStream first, you might not see any symptoms initially. In
          my case, I wrote a passing test that generated a small CSV and
          uploaded it to an S3 mock. However, when the code ran in production,
          it generated part of the CSV, then looped forever.
        </p>

        <p>
          The problem is buffering. PipedInputStreams buffer 1,024 bytes by
          default. Like I did, you might also wrap the former in a
          BufferedReader or the latter in a BufferedWriter, which default to
          using 8,192-byte buffers. As long as the data you write fit into the
          largest buffer in the stream, you won’t notice any problems. Writing
          won’t block because the buffer can hold all the written bytes. Then
          the PipedInputStream can read all the data you wrote. But as soon as
          you write enough data to fill the buffer, your write will block and
          you’ll encounter a deadlock.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the code above demonstrates, the solution is to read on one thread
          and write on another. That way, reading and writing can block without
          preventing the other operation from making progress.
        </p>

        <p>
          After realizing this, I encountered the second gotcha. My code
          initially called <code>generateCsv</code> on the main thread and
          <code>uploadToS3</code> on the thread created by <code>thread</code>.
          The issue is that, when <code>generateCsv</code> finishes, the main
          thread returns from the <code>use</code> block associated with the
          PipedInputStream. This closes the PipedInputStream even if
          <code>uploadToS3</code> is in the middle of reading from it. In my
          case, I noticed that the CSV file written to the S3 mock was
          truncated.
        </p>

        <p>
          To solve this problem, read on the main thread and write on the
          newly-created thread. This way, the PipedInputStream doesn’t close
          until <code>uploadToS3</code> has read everything from it.
        </p>

        <p>
          It took me a few hours to figure out what are in retrospect a couple
          of simple mistakes. My main takeaway is that I need to read
          documentation more carefully. I should also spend more time getting to
          know Java’s I/O primitives better.
