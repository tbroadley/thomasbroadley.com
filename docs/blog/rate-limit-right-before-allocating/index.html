        <p>
          At work last week, I built an API endpoint that allowed logged-out
          visitors to our website to create rows in a database table. I wanted
          to prevent bad actors from adding a bunch of nonsense data to the
          table, so I added rate-limiting based on the user’s IP address. I
          implemented the endpoint as follows: First, it checked the rate limit
          and responded with a 429 if the user had surpassed it. If not, it
          validated the user-provided request data and responded with a 400 if
          it found invalid data. If both checks were successful, it saved the
          valid data to the database.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was only by filling out the HTML form connected to this endpoint
          that I discovered a design flaw. When I submitted invalid data for the
          first time, I’d receive a 400. However, after quickly fixing the
          invalid data and resubmitting it, I’d receive a 429 and wouldn’t be
          able to submit the now-valid data until the rate limit expired. From a
          user’s perspective, this was a terrible experience: If they made an
          error while filling out the form, they’d have to wait several seconds
          each time they tried to correct it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I realized that I wanted to limit the number of requests per user that
          would actually create rows in the database, not the total number of
          requests. Therefore, I changed the endpoint to validate the request
          data, <i>then</i> check the rate limit. This way, the endpoint only
          rate-limits valid requests. Now users can submit many invalid requests
          in a short period of time while trying different ways to fix the
          invalid data.
        </p>

        <p>
          This problem has a mirror image. Suppose you were implementing an
          endpoint with a high CPU cost and wanted to prevent each user from
          making too many requests in a short period of time. Further, suppose
          you implemented the API endpoint to first construct a response to the
          user’s request, then check the rate limit. In this case, the rate
          limit has no effect: A user can still make a large number of requests
          to the endpoint and consume a lot of CPU, even though they receive
          429s for most of the requests. The solution is to rate-limit before
          performing the CPU-intensive operation.
        </p>

        <p>
          These problems point to a general principle. Rate-limiting prevents
          one user from using too much of a shared resource, e.g. database space
          or CPU. The principle is this: Rate-limit right before allocating part
          of that shared resource to a request. If you check the rate limit too
          late, the rate-limiting won’t effectively protect the resource. If you
          check it too early, you’ll end up rate-limiting requests that wouldn’t
          have consumed the resource anyway, which might be a poor experience
          for users.
        </p>

        <p>
          Edit (2020-05-30): A couple of my coworkers pointed out that this
          principle has tradeoffs. In the first example in this article, I added
          a direct call to a rate-limiter method to the endpoint. We wouldn't
          want to do that for every endpoint that adds rows to the database.
          Instead, we could implement a configurable database rate-limiting
          system that allows you to specify different rate limits for insertions
          to different tables. We might want to implement a similar system for
          each shared resource. Contrast this with a single system that only
          allows you to rate-limit the number of requests per endpoint. The
          former allows you to limit bad behaviour more aggressively without
          compromising user experience, but it might not be worth the extra
          complexity.
        </p>

        <p>
          A coworker also mentioned a second use for rate-limiting: preventing
          dictionary attacks, both on sensitive information, like passwords, and
          less sensitive information, like tokens that refer to database
          objects. I think it's possible to treat this as a special case of
          protecting shared resources by considering the search space as a
          shared resource, but I haven't fully worked out this metaphor yet.
