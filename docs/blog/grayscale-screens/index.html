          About a year ago I noticed that a coworker of mine had configured his
          phone’s screen to display everything in grayscale. He told me his goal
          was to make the screen less interesting to look at, to reduce the
          temptation to spend a lot of time looking at it. That convinced me to
          also switch my phone to grayscale.
        </p>

        <p>
          A year in, I’m not sure if the change has had much effect. I still
          spend a lot of time on my phone. I’ve had more success reducing that
          amount of time by disabling or uninstalling apps I spend a lot of time
          on. But whenever I disable grayscale mode, I’m shocked by how vibrant
          and interesting the colours are, so I think it’s had at least a small
          impact.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today I installed
          <a href="https://github.com/laerne/desaturate_all"
            ><code>desaturate_all</code></a
          >, a Gnome extension that enables grayscale mode for Ubuntu. I suppose
          my goal is the same: to make my laptop less interesting to look at.
          Mainly I hope I’ll interact differently with sites like Reddit. If I
          make their content less flashy and visually interesting, maybe I’ll
          spend less time on them.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve also considered purchasing a phone or a monitor with an e-ink
          screen. These screens both enforce grayscale (although colour e-ink
          displays are also available) and don’t strain the eyes as much as
          LCDs. I considered purchasing a Kingrow K1 e-ink smartphone, but was
          deterred by the lack of Google Play support and the difficulty of
          getting it shipped to Canada. Searching again, the Hisense A5 looks
          like a more promising option that I’ll have to investigate further.
