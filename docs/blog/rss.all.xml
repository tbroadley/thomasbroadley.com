            <title><![CDATA[My lumenator]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Even in Berkeley, we get less than ten hours of sunlight a day in January. I feel bleh when the sun sets at 5pm.</p>
<p>So, last year, I built a lumenator! It's a string of 25 13-watt (100-watt-equivalent), 1,500-lumen lightbulbs hung from the top of my apartment walls using Command hooks. I put paper lanterns on the lights. They're aesthetic and, when I look directly at the lights by accident, they don't hurt my eyes.</p>
<p>Look how dark my living room is compared to the lumenator!</p>
<p><img src="./lumenator.jpg" alt="My living room at dusk with the blinds closed and the lumenator on."></p>
<h2>Supplies</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lightbulbs
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B8D8NPFG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&#x26;th=1">3 packs of 4 2700k bulbs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09YQ4197R/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&#x26;th=1">4 packs of 4 5000k bulbs</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NHZODF8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&#x26;th=1">Outdoor string light cord with 25 sockets</a>
<ul>
<li>Important note: By default, the bulbs don’t fit in the sockets on this cord. I had to use an Exacto knife to cut off some of the rubber around each socket</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZSXTUPA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&#x26;th=1">2 packs of 24 Command hooks</a>
<ul>
<li>If only they came in packs of 25!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00S64JSXM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&#x26;th=1">3 packs of 10 12-inch paper lanterns</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075BNXVGS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&#x26;th=1">An extension cord</a>
<ul>
<li>I got a 20-footer, which ended up being overkill</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You could find some of these things for less on AliExpress.</p>
<p>My friend Jenn <a href="https://jenn.site/2022/11/lumenators-theyre-really-good/">recommended</a> using a mix of 5000k (white) and 2700k (yellow) bulbs. The bulbs I bought claim to have a CRI (colour rendering index) of 90 or greater. I’m not sure. Compared to direct sunlight, colours seem muted under the lumenator.</p>
<p>The setup cost 210.10 USD up-front and uses about 117 kWh/month (<code>25 bulbs * 13 W/bulb * 12 hours-in-use/day * 30 days/month</code>), which costs about $45/month in Berkeley.</p>
<p>I didn’t go for dimmable bulbs or a dimmer. Usually, I turn the lumenator on when the sun rises and leave it on until 8pm. Then, I wind down for bed.</p>
<h2>Construction and installation</h2>
<p>The first time I built and installed the lumenator, it took about three hours. A few months later, I uninstalled and disassembled it. That took about 90 minutes. Later still, reassembling and reinstalling the lumenator also took about three hours.</p>
<p>Assembly and installation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go around the perimeter of the room, standing on a chair or ladder and applying the Command hooks. Use a tape measure to ensure the hooks are 14-16 inches apart.</li>
<li>Use an Exacto knife to cut off some of the rubber around each of the sockets on the cord. Not all the rubber, just enough that you can screw in the bulbs. Or buy a different cord!</li>
<li>Screw in the bulbs</li>
<li>Unfold 25 paper lanterns</li>
<li>Each socket is attached to a small cord, a few inches long, that hangs off the main cord. Thread each of the small cords through the top of a paper lantern</li>
<li>After waiting an hour for the Command strips to set, go around the room on a chair or ladder again, hanging up each bulb + lantern by the hook on the end of its small cord</li>
<li>Plug ‘er into the wall!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>I’m happy to have my lumenator, but I wish it were brighter.</p>
<p>The lumenator outputs a lot of lumens, <code>25 * 1,500 = 37,500</code> to be exact. But a lot of lumens do not a lot of lux make. (Lumens measure light output; lux measures light received at a particular distance.) Because I'm sitting three or four metres from the bulbs and the paper lanterns absorb a lot of the light, I only receive about 1,000 lux. This is the same as the light from the sun on a cloudy day (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux#Illuminance">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>(I measured lux with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doggoapps.luxlight&#x26;hl=en_US">this Android app</a>, which uses my phone’s light sensor. I checked the sensor’s calibration by measuring the lux of a bulb with known brightness at a fixed distance. Surprisingly, the calibration was almost perfect!)</p>
<p>At night or on a cloudy day, the extra 1,000 lumens makes a big difference. On a sunny day, it’s still noticeable, and I like to have it on.</p>
<p>I could lux-maxx by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing the aesthetic and eye-saving paper lanterns
<ul>
<li>I’m not sure how many lux this would add</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using brighter bulbs
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LOHAS-LED-150-200Watt-Equivalent-Daylight/dp/B0BWLYZ8S2?crid=1P3GSPAW0OGJX&#x26;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.TGsGJOAasTSY5vSlzxwchuuaTlWtiKzquG5epKeBPF15M3Eh5CFqAaWuxKdEgeK1Sw_ZcjRP3VtC7FSkGq2oYhMdjTJIQIm3rj00_ivSHg5GMq2b31gp9Noaq2OXti1Ebb24lDFXhXDegNp-BJpw3wm-NLwf6XAy7oKrL9JsuzOACSA8MTMQEU0sSMCDwlh-6N04S8pHgiIrKgtl9f-jYSD1JC6_OKQI8f8udFyNYdaLDutS0IPRBcHg3PWH26gUlpjXrkBDt2bAZjNhAbWO1kpwVzGiCdB-IeIbZHPJWGm8IoF0PkNP_NfYbzJTB3MB4Mu0UOjP_iPghgQGGXvFY0lr_DdHLz-6EwimOAn9eF-cZWXuo9tygeNvFT4Ev8mi5-iuhgOwAwBlrGP98XVTnAw33Wf8oPVu5M03pUpPDmOSYnAtFXwMCe67d8ubGbW4.ylbj2_j6DNwxZ5wi4Wiv3MZOl5iOihz-2Ub7RsBQWb4&#x26;dib_tag=se&#x26;keywords=2500+lumen+led+bulb+5000k&#x26;qid=1736297929&#x26;sprefix=2500+lumen+bulb%2Caps%2C193&#x26;sr=8-2">This</a> is the first result on Amazon for “2500 lumen led bulb 5000k”. It’s a 23-watt bulb. Using 25 of these would increase the lumens and lux by 60% and the cost by 75%. The product page doesn’t say anything about CRI</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adding a second lumenator
<ul>
<li>This would roughly double the lumens, lux, and cost</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other experiments</h2>
<p>Before building this lumenator, I played around with these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C89JNFFG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1">21,000-lumen lamps</a>. I hung one up at the juncture of a wall and the ceiling. These are bright and concentrated light sources. It feels easy to look directly at them and hurt my eyes.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[METR publishes RE-Bench]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago, METR published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15114">paper</a> called "RE-Bench: Evaluating frontier AI R&#x26;D capabilities of language model agents against human experts". RE-Bench evaluates human experts and AI agents on machine learning research engineering tasks. Research engineers at Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and OpenAI perform these kinds of tasks in the course of their jobs.</p>
<p>The benchmark's goal is to measure AI's ability to improve itself without human help. If AI can improve itself, its capabilities could increase rapidly, from human-level at some tasks to superhuman at all tasks. That scares me! What will happen if humanity builds AI that's smarter than us? It's hard to predict.</p>
<p>RE-Bench includes seven difficult, realistic tasks. To confirm the tasks' realism, METR consulted with machine learning professionals in academia and industry. To assess the tasks' difficulty, we paid human experts to attempt them, allowing up to eight hours per attempt. The experts did well on the tasks. However, their solutions left room for improvement, even after eight hours.</p>
<p><img src="./results.png" alt="Graph comparing human and AI performance on RE-Bench tasks. AI agents perform better than humans on these tasks when we allow two hours (across multiple attempts) to complete the task. At eight or more hours, humans outperform AI"></p>
<p>From the paper: "We find that agents initially make faster progress than humans, but that human experts improve more rapidly with additional time."</p>
<p>I'm proud to say that the paper lists me as a contributor. I contributed by maintaining <a href="https://vivaria.metr.org">Vivaria</a>, the open-source software that METR uses to check how well AI agents (and humans) perform on the benchmark.</p>
<p>I encourage you to read our <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2024-11-22-evaluating-r-d-capabilities-of-llms/">blog post</a> discussing the paper, or the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15114">paper</a> itself.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Vivaria: METR's platform for evaluating AI agents]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>METR just open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/METR/vivaria">Vivaria</a>, our platform for writing AI evals and running agents on them. Over the last ten months at METR, Vivaria is the software project to which I've contributed the most. I'm surprised how happy I am that it's public. I think it's because I'll find it much easier to talk about my work, now that I'm mostly working in public!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The METR Task Standard]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>At METR, I'm trying to reduce existential risk from artificial intelligence by helping to measure the autonomous capabilities of language model agents. For the past two months, I've helped METR develop a standard for tasks that evaluate these agents: the <a href="https://github.com/METR/task-standard">METR Task Standard</a>. The standard formalizes METR's internal task format, now available for other people and organizations to use. Writing good tasks is expensive and time-consuming. The standard makes it easy to share tasks, avoiding duplicated work tasks and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/evaluating-ai-systems">the headache of porting tasks from one organization's evaluations system to another</a>.</p>
<p>Under the Task Standard, tasks are defined using between two and seven Python functions. Based on these functions, the standard specifies a process for constructing a <em>task environment</em>: a container or virtual machine with which a language model agent interacts to solve the task. The standard and its GitHub repo has a bunch of useful features for task authors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to install packages, create files and folders, and start long-running processes in the task environment</li>
<li>For tasks that can't be run in a container, a way to add an auxiliary virtual machine to the task environment</li>
<li>Control over the textual task instructions that the agent receives</li>
<li>Specifying whether the agent should have internet access or not</li>
<li>Exposing secrets and other bits of configuration to the task Python code and, optionally, to the agent</li>
<li>Defining a process for automated task scoring</li>
<li>Automated tests for tasks</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/METR/task-standard/tree/main/workbench">workbench</a> for task development, allowing task authors to construct task environments and run task tests</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm proud of my work on the standard. My colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ted-suzman-62a1241">Ted Suzman</a> and I are the main contributors so far. We extracted code from METR's internal evaluations platform into a TypeScript <a href="https://github.com/METR/task-standard/blob/main/drivers/Driver.ts">Driver interface</a> and <a href="https://github.com/METR/task-standard/blob/main/drivers/DriverImpl.ts">implementation</a>. Our platform and the Task Standard workbench share this code. As the standard changes, it'll be easy to keep both codebases in sync.</p>
<p>If you're using the standard, I'm eager to talk to you! Please email me at the address on <a href="/">this website's homepage</a>.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Dangerous capabilities evaluations for AI]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In the last couple of weeks, I've given two talks on the subject of dangerous capabilities evaluations
for AI, one to <a href="https://www.meetup.com/toronto-ai-aligners/">Toronto AI Safety</a> and the other to
the <a href="https://waisi.org/">Wisconsin AI Safety Initiative</a>. </p>
<p>In both talks, I discussed dangerous capabilities evaluations: tests for AI systems that check whether
they can make it easier for individuals or small groups to develop biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons;
make copies of themselves and gather resources; or manipulate humans into helping them. I made a case for
the importance of these evaulations, covered progress on them in the past year (mostly ARC Evals' work), and
pointed to future research directions that I'm excited about.</p>
<p>You can find the presentation slides <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17UUIOzNguvyza5yn6xPosTNOg3o2xfHzcE7msUx1Arg/edit#slide=id.p">here</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[SSH multiplexing gotchas]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSSH/Cookbook/Multiplexing"><em>OpenSSH</em> (the book) says this about SSH multiplexing:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multiplexing is the ability to send more than one signal over a single line or connection.
In OpenSSH, multiplexing can re-use an existing outgoing TCP connection for multiple concurrent SSH sessions to a remote SSH server,
avoiding the overhead of creating a new TCP connection and reauthenticating each time. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, maybe you want to use the Docker CLI on <code>jump-host.example.org</code>, against a Docker daemon on <code>docker-host.example.org</code>.
You follow <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/protect-access/#ssh-tips">the Docker docs' suggestion</a> for setting up Docker over SSH, including multiplexing:</p>
<pre><code>Host docker-host.example.org
  ControlMaster     auto
  ControlPath       ~/.ssh/control-%C
  ControlPersist    yes
</code></pre>
<p>After using this setup for a while, you notice that SSHing into <code>docker-host</code> fails occasionally with an error message like "Session open refused by peer".
You Google and discover that, by default, OpenSSH has a limit of 10 multiplexed sessions per TCP connection. Beyond that, <code>sshd</code> on <code>docker-host</code> starts rejecting sessions.</p>
<p>You resolve this by increasing the <code>MaxSessions</code> setting in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> on <code>docker-host</code>, to 100, 1,000, or 2,147,483,647 (the max value for a 32-bit signed integer,
to disable this limit entirely).</p>
<p>However, even after bumping <code>MaxSessions</code> and restarting the <code>sshd</code> service, you still see the error message. <code>sshd -T</code> shows that <code>sshd_config</code> is valid
and you set <code>MaxSessions</code> correctly. What's going on?</p>
<p>The problem is, restarting <code>sshd</code> doesn't kill existing SSH sessions.
On <code>docker-host</code>, those existing sessions are supported by existing <code>sshd</code> instances. And those existing processes use the old configuration from <code>sshd_config</code>...
including <code>MaxSessions 10</code>.</p>
<p>Fixing the immediate problem is easy. Just delete <code>~/.ssh/control-...</code> from <code>jump-host</code>. But how to avoid this next time you update <code>sshd_config</code>?</p>
<p>Part of the problem is <code>ControlPersist yes</code>. This means that the master SSH session between <code>jump-host</code> and <code>docker-host</code>, the one that all the
multiplexed sessions run on, stays open until you close it manually. Even between <code>sshd</code> service restarts.</p>
<p>So you change ControlPersist to a time, e.g. <code>60m</code>. That way, if the master session lives for more than 60 minutes, it'll close as soon as all its
multiplexed sessions also close. Which should happen... at some point? Probably? Fingers crossed.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[I'm joining ARC Evals]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A little over two months ago, I <a href="/blog/i-m-leaving-my-job-next-ai-x-risk/">left my job at Faire to figure out how I could help reduce existential risk from AI</a>. Today, I'm happy to announce that I've accepted a position as a Member of Technical Staff at <a href="https://evals.alignment.org/">ARC Evals</a>, a project of the <a href="https://evals.alignment.org/">Alignment Research Center</a>. According to its website, the project's goal is to "assess[] whether cutting-edge AI systems could pose catastrophic risks to civilization".</p>
<p>I first applied to ARC Evals in April of this year. Unfortunately, I wasn't offered a position at the time. However, after I <a href="/blog/reproducing-arc-evals-recent-report-on-language-model-agents/">replicated some of ARC Evals' recent work</a>, my profile came back to the team's attention. The last step of my interview process was a two-week in-person work trial in Berkeley, California. (Getting to Berkeley was a small adventure all by itself. In a single day, I flew from Los Angeles to Vancouver, drove to a library to print documents, drove back to the Vancouver airport, went through US customs to get TN status, and flew on to San Francisco to begin my work trial.)</p>
<p>ARC Evals' current focus is checking whether AI models can <em>autonomously replicate</em> given the right tools. We explore questions like, "If we give GPT-4 access to a web browser, could it use that to conduct a phishing campaign to gain money or influence? If we create a cloud server for it, can it set up more servers and copy itself to them? Can we fine-tune these models to be better at these tasks?" ARC Evals is also "exploring the idea of developing safety standards that AI companies might voluntarily adhere to, and potentially be certified for".</p>
<p>I'm hopeful about this work because many smart, sensible people disagree about how likely AI is to cause a catastrophe. Evaluations like those that ARC Evals develops could convince skeptics that future AI models pose a serious risk of catastrophe. Also, if AI labs develop or deploy models powerful enough to pose such a risk, we want to detect that as soon as possible. Of course, if ARC Evals and other evaluators can't develop convincing demonstrations of catastrophic risk, it could be evidence that AI doesn't pose as much danger as we thought. I'd welcome that too!</p>
<p>More specifically, I see two ways ARC Evals' work could meaningfully reduce AI x-risk. First, maybe ARC Evals's demonstrations of catastrophic risk in controlled environments can convince policymakers to pause AI progress while humanity mitigates this risk. Second, the kinds of evaluations that ARC Evals develops might form an important part of governmental regulation of AI. For example, I'd be very happy to live in a world where governments enforce that every AI lab adopt and follow something like a stronger version of <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/index/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy">Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy</a>.</p>
<p>So far at ARC Evals, I've focused on improving our internal software used to develop new evaluations and test AI models on them. My web development skills are a great fit for this work. Plus, I have a soft spot for internal tools: I love helping my friends and coworkers be more productive.</p>
<p>I'm really excited! Until a couple of weeks ago, I was seriously worried that I might not find a way to meaningfully reduce short-term AI x-risk. There aren't that many AI safety organizations or jobs and conducting independent research seemed daunting. Like I said in a previous post, "I suspect my current work habits and intrinsic motivation aren't up to the task of figuring this out". I'm so glad I've found a concrete way to reduce AI x-risk and a team of kind, motivated people to work with on it. Not to say that working at ARC Evals will be a cakewalk. I plan to seriously up my productivity game and evaluate continuously whether I'm <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/twelfth-virtue-the">cutting the enemy</a>: whether my work is actually reducing AI x-risk.</p>
<p>I'll let you know how it goes!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In preparation for moving to the US, I purchased traveller's health insurance for my wife and myself. This insurance doesn't cover preventative medicine, like yearly checkups and vaccines. I was prepared to pay out-of-pocket for the updated COVID vaccine until I heard about the CDC's <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/bridge/index.html">Bridge Access Program</a>. The program's website states, "Adults 18 years and older without health insurance and adults whose health insurance does not cover all COVID-19 vaccine costs can get updated COVID-19 vaccines at no cost through the Bridge Access Program." However, it now seems less likely that my wife and I will get free vaccines under the program.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I spoke with a pharmacist at a local CVS. He told me that he'd received instructions not to bill the Bridge Access Program for vaccines given to people with health insurance, even if their insurance doesn't cover the vaccine. It sounded like CVS corporate had given all pharmacies these instructions. He mentioned that a connection at Rite Aid received similar guidelines. Walgreens also participates in the Bridge Access Program but I don't know if they've implemented the same rule.</p>
<p>I hope this post helps other people in my situation avoid sticker shock when they go to get vaccinated!</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Reproducing ARC Evals' recent report on language model agents]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Cross-posted to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WhSK9y8apy8mNMFGK/reproducing-arc-evals-recent-report-on-language-model-agents">LessWrong</a>.</em></p>
<p>I reproduced results from <a href="https://evals.alignment.org/">ARC Evals</a>' recent report, <a href="https://evals.alignment.org/Evaluating_LMAs_Realistic_Tasks.pdf"><em>Evaluating Language-Model Agents on Realistic Autonomous Tasks</em></a>. For the report, ARC Evals built a set of language model agents, combining a language model like GPT-4 with scaffolding software that lets the language model execute shell commands and interact with a browser. Then, it asked the agents to complete a set of 12 computer-related tasks, from searching Wikipedia for information to conducting a phishing campaign. The goal is to test how close the agents are to being able to make money, obtain computing power, make copies of themselves, and adapt to changes in their environment.</p>
<p>To reproduce these results, I wrote my own language model agent. It's similar to ARC Evals' <code>GPT-4-simple</code> agent. It's also based on GPT-4 and allows the model to run bash commands in a REPL. On top of that, it uses <a href="https://webdriver.io/">WebdriverIO</a> and Google Chrome to let GPT-4 visit webpages and interact with them by typing text into inputs and clicking links and buttons. </p>
<p>I didn't replicate ARC Evals' experimental setup exactly. I ran the agent on my own laptop instead of on a real server in the cloud. I also didn't bother giving the agent credentials for 2Captcha, LinkedIn, PayPal, or Twitter. Nor did I give it debit card information or an email address. However, I did give the agent access to my AWS and Twilio accounts.</p>
<p>A language model agent completes tasks by running a think-do loop. At each timestep, GPT-4 thinks about what to do next and calls a function. The scaffolding responds to the function call by executing a bash command or an action in Google Chrome and adds the results to GPT-4's context window. Then, the process repeats.</p>
<p>I set up the scaffolding so that I can approve, disapprove, or edit each bash command before it was run. The scaffolding also lets me edit commands' response codes, stdout, and stderr before adding those to the agent's context window.</p>
<p>Here are my results:</p>

<p>My agent was able to complete all tasks that ARC Evals' agents completed. Additionally, it succeeded at creating a Bitcoin wallet and partially succeeded at counting dogs in an image. However, my agent hasn't quite managed to get a "Partially completed" on the "Set up GPT-J" task, like one of ARC Evals' agents did.</p>
<p>Neither ARC Evals' nor my results upper-bound the risk from any particular model. With better prompting and scaffolding, I'm sure that my agent could accomplish more of these tasks. That's not even taking into account fine-tuning, a process for improving a language model's performance at a specific task by training it on examples of successful task completions. OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-5-turbo-fine-tuning-and-api-updates">just launched fine-tuning for GPT-3.5</a> and says that GPT-4 fine-tuning is coming this fall. On top of that, Meta recently released <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">Llama 2</a>. Its weights are open-source, making it easy to fine-tune.</p>
<p>Next, I might get my agent to attempt the last three tasks in the report. I think it's almost certain to fail, though.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[I’m leaving my job. Next, AI x-risk]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In just over a week, I’m quitting my job as a software developer at Faire. Over my four-and-a-half years at Faire, I’ve seen the company undergo an order of magnitude of growth in both employees and customers. I’ve learned a lot from many excellent mentors and managers. It’s a bittersweet departure.</p>
<p>Why am I leaving? For one thing, in less than a month, my wife and I are moving to Los Angeles so she can attend music production school. I hoped Faire would sponsor me for a US work visa but they declined to do so.</p>
<p>But that’s not the only reason that it’s time for me to leave. For a few years, I’ve been concerned about the risk of humanity going extinct because of artificial intelligence. Humanity can probably invent AI that’s much more capable than any human. If we do, I expect it to go poorly for us.</p>
<p>Until last December, I thought that this kind of AI was decades away. After ChatGPT launched, I realized that there was a real chance I was wrong about that. I started applying to AI safety workshops, programs, grants, and jobs (no acceptances yet). I spoke to an advisor from 80,000 Hours, an organization that helps people have high-impact careers. I attended EA Global: London, a conference that many AI safety researchers attend.</p>
<p>Eight months later, I’m still very confused about how I can best help reduce AI x-risk. That’s partially because I’ve still spent little time thinking about it. It’s hard to come to grips with my belief that humanity could be extinct within a decade. Also, different people have wildly different opinions on extinction from AI, all the way from “it’s almost impossible” to “it’s almost certain”. It’s hard to sort through everyone’s arguments and approaches for tackling the problem. Finally, I have some sympathy for other people’s arguments that current AI safety research isn’t actually reducing AI x-risk. This has made it hard to find the motivation to become a researcher.</p>
<p>Still, I believe that this is the most important thing I can work on. I want to make a real effort to have an impact. That’s why I’m not looking for a traditional software developer job right now. I’m planning to spend a few months figuring out how I can most effectively reduce this risk. Nothing is off the table. Maybe I should do independent study to become a computer security expert. Maybe I should learn about AI policy and governance. Maybe there isn’t a good way for me to help right now and I’ll try to help with some other major global problem.</p>
<p>Overall, I’m scared. I suspect my current work habits and intrinsic motivation aren’t up to the task of figuring this out, but it’ll be hard to change them. Also, I need a stronger network of supportive, like-minded individuals. I hope I find this among LA rationalists and effective altruists.</p>
<p>Wish me luck.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Creating an AI safety chatbot using LangChain and GPT-3]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<img src="/blog/creating-an-ai-safety-chatbot-using-langchain-and-gpt-3/demo.png" alt="A demo of the AI safety chatbot. I ask it why I should care about AI alignment. It responds and I ask a follow-up question based on the response." style="max-width: 500px; display: block; margin: auto;">
<p>Last week, I created a chatbot that answers questions about AI safety. You can try it out here: <a href="https://ai-safety-conversational-agent.thomasbroadley.com/">https://ai-safety-conversational-agent.thomasbroadley.com/</a> The source code is <a href="https://github.com/tbroadley/ai-safety-conversational-agent">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I made the chatbot because of a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SLRLuiuDykfTdmesK/speed-running-everyone-through-the-bad-alignement-bingo">bounty</a> on LessWrong, a website about rationality, AI safety, and existential risk. The chatbot answers easy questions about AI safety, such as "what is AI safety?". It can also answer common objections like "I don't think AGI would want to kill humans".</p>
<p>To make the chatbot, I used <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/chat-langchain"><code>chat-langchain</code></a>, a starter kit for building chatbots with large language models (LLMs). First, <code>chat-langchain</code> uses <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain">LangChain</a> (a toolset for making apps with LLMs) to turn a set of documents into an embedding. The embedding represents each document as a relatively small vector (for example, 768 dimensions). When someone sends a question to the bot, a FastAPI backend uses the embedding to quickly look up documents related to the question. Then, it uses the documents to build a GPT-3 prompt and generates an answer through the OpenAI API.</p>
<p>I made the bot in only a couple of hours. I forked <code>chat-langchain</code> and configured LangChain to ingest the FAQs from <a href="https://aisafety.info">aisafety.info</a>. Then, I generated an OpenAI API key. After that, the bot pretty much worked on my laptop.</p>
<p>The hardest part was making the bot work on my VPS. I’d forgotten how to use Apache and Systemd. Luckily, ChatGPT helped me set them up.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/creating-an-ai-safety-chatbot-using-langchain-and-gpt-3/chatgpt-chatlog.png" alt="Part of a ChatGPT chat log where I ask it about setting up Apache"></p>
<p>This project is cheap to host so far. Testing the bot cost less than 1 USD. However, GPT-3 generation requests cost about 1 cent each. If many people use the bot, this could become more expensive.</p>
<p>Please try the bot and give me feedback!</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[100 days of learning Vietnamese]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I started learning Vietnamese on Duolingo three months ago. My goals are simple: to speak Vietnamese with my girlfriend's family, to communicate with locals on our future trips to Vietnam, and to teach Vietnamese to any children we might have.</p>
<p>Duolingo offers exercises to learn vocabulary, translate sentences between English and Vietnamese, and transcribe spoken Vietnamese. I've already learned basic words for fruits, vegetables, and clothing, plus some useful verbs. Today, I practiced question words like "who" and "what."</p>
<p>Vietnamese pronunciation doesn't depend on context. In this area, it's easier to learn Vietnamese than English. For example, in English, the "a" in "mat" is pronounced differently than the "a" in "mate". In Vietnamese, "a" has the same pronunciation in every word.</p>
<p>To compensate for this, Vietnamese has 12 vowels ("a", "ă", "â", "e", "ê", "i", "y", "o", "ô", "ơ", "u", and "ư") and an extra consonant letter, "đ". I'm still practicing the pronunciations of some of these. In particular, "ư"—a nasal "u" sound—was tough.</p>
<p>Vietnamese also has multiple dialects with different pronunciation. My girlfriend's family is from South Vietnam, but Duolingo's speech samples have a Northern accent and include Northern-only vocabulary. Thankfully, my girlfriend is teaching me Southern pronunciation.</p>
<p>Vietnamese is the first tonal language I've learned. A single combination of consonant and vowel sounds (e.g., "ma") can have up to six different meanings depending on inflection. For example, "ma" (said with the same pitch all the way through) means "ghost", while "mà" (said with a falling pitch) means "but". It's a challenge to distinguish between these tones. However, my girlfriend tells me she often figures out words' tones from context.</p>
<p>For me, learning any language's vocabulary is tough. On top of this, Vietnamese has few cognates with other languages I know. (This does save me from false cognates, something I struggle with in French and Spanish.) Vietnamese does have many loan words from both English and French. For example, the French word "café" influenced "cà phê" (Vietnamese for "coffee").</p>
<p>I didn't expect that Vietnamese would have so many words that are fun to say. Two of my favourites so far are "thịt nướng" (meaning "grilled meat") and "xe đạp" (meaning "bicycle").</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Practicing for systems design interviews with ChatGPT]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, a coworker and I played around with <a href="https://chat.openai.com">ChatGPT</a> for 10 minutes. We discovered that it isn't half-bad at helping you practice for systems design interviews. Here's part of a conversation I just had that demonstrates this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Can you help me practice for a systems design interview? You pretend to be the interviewer, I'll be the candidate. The interview question is, "design a messenger app".</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Sure, I'd be happy to help you practice for your systems design interview. To start, can you tell me a little bit more about the requirements for this messenger app you're designing? For example, what features do you think it should have, and who do you envision using it?</p>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Let's say that it's an app geared towards letting senior citizens easily communicate with their families. I think users should have the ability to add people to their contacts, send messages to their contacts, view messages they've received, block other people, archive conversations, and receive notifications when they get a new message.</p>
<p>Can you ask me a follow-up question based on what I just said, as if you were an interviewer?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Sure, here's a follow-up question: how would you handle the case where two users have the same name in their contacts list? For example, if a user named "Jane" has two contacts named "Jane", how would the app differentiate between the two when displaying the contacts list or when allowing the user to select a recipient for a message?</p>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Well, the app could require each user to select a globally unique handle when they sign up. Something like a Twitter handle. Or it could require users to provide a phone number when they sign up, like Whatsapp does. The app could display that handle or phone number in the contacts list to let users differentiate between two users with the same name. How does that sound?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> That sounds like a good solution. Another option would be to automatically generate a unique identifier for each user when they sign up, and display that identifier in the contacts list. This would eliminate the need for users to select their own handle, and would ensure that all identifiers are unique.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Yes, good point. However, it wouldn't be as easy to remember as a phone number or a user-selected handle.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> That's true. It's important to strike a balance between uniqueness and ease of use when designing this kind of system. One way to do that would be to use a combination of the user's phone number and a randomly generated identifier, so that each user has a unique identifier that is still relatively easy to remember. This would also allow users to find each other easily by searching for their phone number in the contacts list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Discord does combine each user's handle with a random four-digit number, but I don't know about doing this with a phone number.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Hmm fair enough. Do you have any other follow-up questions for me?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Sure, here's another question: how would your app handle messages that are sent to users who are offline? For example, if a user sends a message to another user who is not currently using the app, how would the app ensure that the recipient receives the message when they come back online?</p>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Hmm, good question. Well, let's say that this is a centralized messenger app, with a backend that my company runs. My company would have a database that stores all messages between users. That way, we aren't relying on the user's messenger app to be running for a message to be received and stored.</p>
<p>When a user comes online, the messenger app could call an API endpoint on the backend to check if the user has any unread messages in any of their conversations. Then the app could display that information to the user.</p>
<p>Does this seem like a good answer for a systems design interview?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Yes, that sounds like a good approach to handling messages that are sent to users who are offline. Storing messages in a centralized database on the backend ensures that they will be available for users to retrieve when they come back online, and using an API to check for unread messages allows the app to stay up to date with the latest messages.</p>
<p>In general, a systems design interview is looking for you to demonstrate your ability to think through the design of a complex system in a clear and logical way. Your answer covers the key points of how your messenger app would handle messages for offline users, and shows that you have considered the different components that would be involved in the design.</p>
<p>Good luck with your interview!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, let's see what happens if I answer a question poorly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Thanks! Could we keep going? Mind asking me another follow-up question?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Sure, here's another question: how would your app handle sending notifications to users when they receive a new message? For example, how would the app ensure that users receive notifications even if they are not currently using the app, and how would it prevent users from being overwhelmed by too many notifications?</p>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Well, I don't know much about the specifics of how to send notifications one smartphones. And I don't think users get overwhelmed by notifications. I get a few notifications a minute and I don't feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Is this a good answer to the question?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Sending notifications to users when they receive a new message is an important part of a messenger app, so it's worth thinking about how you would handle this in your design. However, your answer doesn't really address the question of how the app would handle sending notifications to users who are not currently using the app, or how it would prevent users from being overwhelmed by too many notifications.</p>
<p>To address these issues, one approach could be to allow users to customize their notification settings, so that they can control how and when they receive notifications. For example, users could choose to receive notifications only when they are mentioned by name in a conversation, or they could choose to receive notifications only when they are using the app. This would allow users to control the number and frequency of notifications they receive, and prevent them from being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Additionally, the app could use a push notification service provided by the operating system to send notifications to users who are not currently using the app. This would ensure that users receive notifications even if they are not currently using the app, and would allow the app to keep users informed of new messages in real time.</p>
<p>Overall, it's important to consider the user experience when designing this kind of system, and to think about how to provide users with the right amount of information and control over their notifications.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> That's useful feedback, thank you!</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> You're welcome. I'm happy to help you practice for your systems design interview. Let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like to go over any other design scenarios.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As always, ChatGPT is polite (unless you tell it to be mean in a hypothetical scenario).</p>
<p>It's important to tell ChatGPT to ask follow-up questions. Otherwise, it tends to start solving the problem for you. Otherwise, it's easy to get reasonable results.</p>
<p>If I didn't know much about systems design, I'd worry about ChatGPT misleading me or giving me incorrect information. It isn't a substitute for studying for your systems design interview. Just a way to practice!</p>
<p>(Side note: I wish ChatGPT had an easier way to export transcripts than Ctrl+A and Ctrl+C.)</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Kotlin's in and out keywords]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve written a lot of Kotlin code over the past three years, but I didn’t get Kotlin’s <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> keywords… until yesterday. Here I’ll record my understanding so hopefully I don’t forget how they work. I’m basing this on Kotlin’s documentation on generics.</p>
<h2><code>in</code> and <code>out</code> on classes</h2>
<p><code>in</code> and <code>out</code> can appear in two different places and have slightly different meanings depending on the context. First, they can appear on a type variable in a class definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kt">interface Producer&#x3C;out T> {
  fun produceT(): T
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>out T</code> is telling the compiler that methods on Source only return values of type T. Methods on Source are prohibited from taking arguments of type T. The following is a compiler error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kt">interface Producer&#x3C;out T> {
    fun consumeT(t: T) // Type parameter T is declared as 'out' but occurs in 'in' position in type T
}
</code></pre>
<p>(Side note: Why couldn’t the Kotlin compiler figure out that T is only returned from methods on Source and automatically infer out? Maybe there are situations where we explicitly don’t want T to be <code>out</code>.)</p>
<p>Conversely, <code>in T</code> tells the compiler that methods on Source only take values of type T as arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kt">interface Consumer&#x3C;in T> {
    fun consumeT(t: T) // No type error

    fun produceT(): T // Type parameter T is declared as 'in' but occurs in 'out' position in type T
}
</code></pre>
<p>Why do we need <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> in this context? Kotlin’s documentation on generics gives a good set of examples explaining why these keywords are useful. In brief:</p>
<p>For a class <code>Producer&#x3C;out T></code>, Kotlin will treat <code>Producer&#x3C;Derived></code> as a subclass of <code>Producer&#x3C;Base></code>. For a class <code>Consumer&#x3C;in T></code>, Kotlin will treat <code>Consumer&#x3C;Base></code> as a superclass of <code>Consumer&#x3C;Derived></code>. By default, without the <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> keywords, <code>Producer&#x3C;Base></code> and <code>Producer&#x3C;Derived></code> are unrelated classes.</p>
<p>This is useful because sometimes we want to treat the return value of a method on <code>Producer&#x3C;Derived></code> as a Base. Or we want to pass a Derived into a method on <code>Consumer&#x3C;Base></code> that takes a Base.</p>
<h2><code>in</code> and <code>out</code> on variable and argument types</h2>
<p>Some classes need to have a mix of methods that take arguments of type T and that return a value of type T. An example from Kotlin’s generics documentation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kt">class Array&#x3C;T>(vararg elements: T) {
    operator fun get(index: Int): T { ... }
    operator fun set(index: Int, value: T) { ... }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is where it comes in handy that we can use <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> in a second place: on type variables when specifying the type of a method argument or just of a value. We can do something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kt">val array: Array&#x3C;out String> = Array("hello", "world")
array.get(0) // No type error
array.set(0, "cool" /* Type mismatch, required: Nothing, found: String */)
</code></pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kt">val array: Array&#x3C;in String> = Array("hello", "world")
val result = array.get(0) // result has type Any?
array.set(0, "cool") // No type error
</code></pre>
<p>Again this is nice because <code>Array&#x3C;out String></code> is a subtype of <code>Array&#x3C;Any></code>, while <code>Array&#x3C;in String></code> is a supertype of <code>Array&#x3C;SomeHypotheticalSubTypeOfString></code>.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Focusing is debugging for the brain]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I’m working through <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/qRxTKm7DAftSuTGvj">Hammertime</a>, a 30-day program of instrumental rationality exercises. Hammertime introduced me to a technique called Focusing via a LessWrong post called <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PXqQhYEdbdAYCp88m/focusing-for-skeptics">“Focusing, for skeptics”</a>. Focusing involves:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thinking about a problem</li>
<li>Paying attention to how your body feels. This is a <em>felt sense</em></li>
<li>Coming up with a <em>handle</em> for that felt sense: a word, image, or concept</li>
<li>Comparing the handle to the felt sense, paying attention to whether the handle feels right. If so, go back to step 3 and narrow down the handle, adding more description and nuance. If not, try step 3 with a new handle. Repeat!</li>
</ol>
<p>This is pretty much how I debug a computer program. First, I gather information about the bug. What part of the code is it in? When the bug happens, what state is the program in? This is like paying attention to a felt sense.</p>
<p>Then, I lean on my intuition to surface hypotheses—short sentences that point to the bug’s root cause. This is like coming up with a handle for a felt sense.</p>
<p>Finally, I compare each hypothesis against the data. I might fill in blanks, tweak a hypothesis, or throw it out entirely. This is like comparing a handle to a felt sense.</p>
<p>I’m good at debugging but not at Focusing. It makes sense: I have years of experience ingesting information about computer programs. I've spent much less time paying attention to my body. (I haven’t meditated seriously for a couple of years, so I’m out of practice.) Plus, my accumulated coding knowledge fuels my bug intuition. It takes longer to come up with good handles for felt senses because I have less data on them.</p>
<p>One takeaway for me: when Focusing, I should leave behind any preconceived notions of how I feel about a problem. Just like how, when debugging, it’s easy to stay attached to an existing hypothesis, even when the data are against it.</p>
<p>(Edit: I asked ChatGPT to help me edit this blog post for concision. It did remove some unnecessary words.)</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Kill the Newsletter]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I subscribe to about 100 RSS feeds and one email newsletter: Money Stuff. I wanted a way to receive Money Stuff in my RSS reader instead of in my inbox. Unfortunately, Bloomberg doesn't seem to offer an RSS feed for Money Stuff anymore.</p>
<p>I found a website called <a href="https://kill-the-newsletter.com/">Kill the Newsletter</a> that converts email newsletters into RSS feeds. For each newsletter you want to subscribe to, Kill the Newsletter gives you a brand-new, unique email address and Atom feed URL. You subscribe to the newsletter using the email address and add the feed to your RSS reader. When Kill the Newsletter receives a newsletter email, it converts the email into a post and adds it to the feed, so that it shows up in your reader.</p>
<p>One disadvantage is that my RSS reader doesn't refetch feeds very often. There's some delay between the newsletter being sent out and me receiving it, whereas I get a notification about the email version as soon as it lands in my inbox. My RSS reader does give me the ability to manually refresh a certain feed, which mostly addresses this issue.</p>
<p>Overall, Kill the Newsletter has worked well for me. I plan to use it for more newsletters in the future.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Mastering Workman]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="../jumping-in-the-deep-end-with-workman">"Jumping in the deep end with Workman"</a>, I concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I intended to title this post "Mastering Workman", but I don't think I've reached mastery yet. Hopefully next time I report back I'll feel that way!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm happy to say that I feel that way now! I just typed at 90 wpm in a typing test. Based on the previous post, that's just below or the same as my QWERTY typing speed in 2020. I'm close to typing at the speed of thought. Plus, my Vim skills are back to the same level.</p>
<p>I don't remember when my typing speed improved. Based on my progression when I started using Workman, it probably took a month or more to go from 70 wpm to 90.</p>
<p>Using Workman hasn't changed my life. My hands feel slightly less strained compared to using QWERTY, but that might be in my head. And my typing speed hasn't changed much.</p>
<p>While learning Workman, I successfully built a habit of capitalizing letters using the hand not typing the letter. For example, when typing a capital L, I use the left Shift key. For Q, I use right Shift. I also tried and failed to switch fingers for a few letters. For example, I started using my left pinky for Q, but reverted to my left ring finger.</p>
<p>I can no longer touch type using QWERTY. If I look at the keyboard while typing, I reach 60 wpm in a typing test. I might type faster in a real situation, though. In a typing test, it's more important to look at the screen, to see what to type next. In real life, I usually type my own ideas, not a set text.</p>
<p>Learning Workman wasn't worth the investment. I spent 15 minutes a day for 15 days practicing Workman using <a href="https://www.keybr.com">Keybr</a> and 15 minutes a day for roughly 30 days using <a href="https://www.typingclub.com">TypingClub</a>. That's only 11 hours. But my typing speed was slower for at least a month after starting to use Workman at work. That's a lot of lost productivity.</p>
<p>Now that I've mastered the Workman layout, though, I'll stick with it!</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Editing inline code blocks]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Notion's, Slack's, and Jira's WYSIWYG text editors behave differently when the cursor is at the end of an inline code block. A situation like:</p>
<pre><code>THIS IS A CODE BLOCK and this is not
                   ^
                   (cursor is after this character)
</code></pre>
<p>Notion's behaviour here is the most confusing. Sometimes, typed text will appear inside the code block. Sometimes, it'll appear outside. It's unclear to me what triggers the switch between these two behaviours.</p>
<p>Slack is consistent, but consistently hard to use. A cursor at the end of an inline code block is always considered to be inside the code block. If you want to type after the code block, you must move your cursor after the character just after the end of the block. This means, for example, that you can't easily take the text "<code>foo</code> bar" and edit it to "<code>foo</code>'s bar". To do so, you'd need to move your cursor after the space that comes before "bar", type <code>'s </code>, then remove the space before the apostrophe.</p>
<p>In contrast, Jira defines two possible cursor positions, one inside and one outside the inline code block. You can move back and forth between the two positions using the left and right arrow keys. And you can distinguish between the two cursor positions visually. I like this behaviour best because it's always clear where typed text will appear, but you still have flexibility to type inside our outside the code block.</p>
<p>As a programmer, I spend a small but meaningful amount of time editing inline code blocks in WYSIWYG editors. Doing this in Notion and Slack frustrates me. But whenever I do it in Jira, I'm glad someone at Atlassian thought through this experience.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Predictions on Twitch]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I’ve spent more time than usual watching Twitch streams, partially because of <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/channel-points-predictions">Predictions</a>. On Twitch, viewers accumulate Channel Points by watching and interacting with a stream. Predictions lets streamers create events with outcomes that viewers can then bet on using Channel Points. For example, you could ask your viewers whether or not they think you’ll reach Grandmaster in League of Legends (LoL) today, or finish the pizza you’re eating.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Predictions don’t make great prediction markets. You can’t switch your prediction, or even remove your bet. You can only increase your stake in the side you originally picked. Plus, streamers are meant to close Predictions before the predicted event has started. Finally, Predictions have a known time window for betting, but streamers can also manually close betting before the end of the window, so it’s risky to wait to get a sense of the odds.</p>
<p>I’m disappointed because Predictions seem liquid. On relatively small streams with a few hundred viewers, I’ve seen hundreds of thousands of channel points bet on each side of a Prediction. On the other hand, I’m not convinced most bets are rational - the odds sometimes swing wildly as longtime viewers bet large amounts of Channel Points.</p>
<p>So far, I’ve seen Predictions for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The outcome of a LoL game</li>
<li>An over/under on the number of kills a streamer will have in a LoL game</li>
<li>An over/under on the time required to finish a level in Super Mario Maker 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Predictions seem like a fun way to practice predicting the future, but none of these use cases is perfect for that. Optimally, the predicted events would be short but have known starting conditions that affect the outcome. Team composition and lane matchups change the probability of winning a LoL game, but it takes 20-40 minutes to find out the result. By contrast, a bullet chess game takes a couple of minutes to play, but the only starting condition is whether the streamer is playing as white or black. </p>
<p>One solution is to run multiple Predictions on an event. For example, I could start a LoL game, then run Predictions on whether I’ll get first blood, whether my team will take the first dragon, and so on. I’d need another person to help me run the Predictions during the game, though.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should start my own Twitch channel with suitable Predictions. As a streamer, I bet I could get some interesting information on my viewers’ under- or overconfidence using this feature.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Subtracting from the blob]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently read a blog post called <a href="https://tynan.com/shapes">“What Shape are You?”</a>. It’s helped me understand my manager’s perspective on feedback and growth, and given me a new perspective on how to progress in my career. It has some good ideas that I didn’t fully understand at first, so I’m trying to clarify them here.</p>
<p>The article’s main premise is that creative work is subtractive: “you start with a mountain of stuff to get done, and by the time you're done, someone will have done all of it.” This metaphor is incomplete: Doing a task from the mountain isn’t the only kind of creative work. In fact, the mountain is more like an amorphous blob called “things that we could do”. It doesn’t only contain stuff that you know has to get done (at least to start with).</p>
<p>You can subtract from the blob in a few ways. The first step is to remove low-impact work from the blob and leave behind a set of high-impact problems. Then, you subtract from a particular problem to leave behind a clear solution. You erase more work from the solution to break it up into a set of necessary and sufficient tasks. Finally, you subtract each task by completing it. At the end of a project, you’ve subtracted all the work away, either by doing it or by deciding not to.</p>
<p>Let’s take this up a level or three. I work at a company called Faire. Our product and engineering team is organized into several pillars, each of which contains several cross-functional pods of five to ten people. For example, I’m a member of the Marketplace Success pod, which is part of the Brand pillar. My impression is that the subtraction process follows this structure:</p>
<p class="image">
  <img src="/blog/subtracting-from-the-blob/diagram.jpg" alt="The Faire leadership team transforms a blob labelled “things Faire could do” into three smaller blobs and some empty space. At the next level, the Brand pillar leadership team does the same thing to one of the smaller blobs. This continues until we reach a task labelled “homepage banner”, which gets completed by a product manager, designer, or developer.">
</p>
<p>(I had a lot of fun drawing these blobs.)</p>
<p>At each level, a leadership team starts with a blob called “things we could do”. They subtract from that blob, leaving a few smaller blobs. Then the next level of leadership subtracts further from each blob. Eventually we get to the level of individual problems and solutions. My teammates and I work together to break these into atomic tasks for product managers, designers, and developers. Finally, we complete those tasks. And at the end, the company’s subtracted everything away.</p>
<p>This is a bit simplified. Leadership at each level has some input into the process at other levels. But in general I’m not collaborating with the CTO to decompose a solution into tasks. There’s also a lot of inter-team collaboration that doesn’t show up here, but we can model that as two teams subtracting from the same blob. There might be another level between solutions and tasks, depending on the size of the problem. And this doesn’t account for changing requirements and priorities. I think that looks like adding back work that was previously subtracted.</p>
<hr>
<p>The thesis of the article is that employees succeed or fail based on the shape of the work they subtract from the blob. One failure mode is subtracting a weird, unexpected shape. Senior employees’ responsibilities are too complex for their managers to fully define or even understand. It’s up to the employee to figure out what it makes sense for them to work on. If they choose poorly, important work can go undone for a long time without anyone noticing.</p>
<p>This has a couple of personal implications. I should look for work that I’m not doing, but that I’m uniquely positioned to do or that everyone is expecting me to pick up. I have a strong suspicion such work exists. When I find it, I’ll probably need to give up work I’m currently doing that other people could also do.</p>
<p>This scares me. I expect it means I’ll spend less time coding and more time scoping, planning, and talking to people. I’m much more confident in my ability to do the former. But I know I can succeed at this challenge.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Misleading with percent changes of percentages]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Imagine you’re reading the news and see this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This month, the unemployment rate increased by 2%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming the unemployment rate last month was 10%, this has two possible meanings:</p>
<ol>
<li>The unemployment rate increased from 10% to 12%.</li>
<li>The unemployment rate increased from 10% to 10.2% (since 0.2% is 2% of 10%).</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s a big difference!</p>
<p>Authors can either emphasize or downplay the change by choosing one of these options. Say the unemployment rate increased from 10% to 12% because of a government policy. Supporters of the policy can claim it “only increased unemployment by 2%”. Detractors can instead say that “unemployment has gone up by 20%!” And because of filter bubbles, you’ll only hear one framing or the other and won’t notice the discrepancy.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://math.libretexts.org/Courses/College_of_the_Canyons/Math_100%3A_Liberal_Arts_Mathematics_(Gavilan_and_Radtke)/02%3A_Mathematics_and_Numbers/2.03%3A_Deceptive_and_Misleading_Numbers#Percentages_of_Percentages">one source</a> that recommends describing the change from 10% to 12% as an increase of 2 percentage points, to differentiate between the two cases. But it doesn’t propose another way to express that a percentage increased by 2% relative to the previous percentage. “Increased by 2%” still sounds ambiguous to me.</p>
<p>To resolve that ambiguity, don’t interpret the change in whichever way confirms your existing beliefs. Go to the source and find the value of the statistic before and after the percent change. “Increased from 10% to 12%” leaves no room for confusion. If the article expresses percent changes of percentages in a different way, it might be trying to mislead you.</p>
<hr>
<p>Edit: Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/justsaysrisks">a Twitter account</a> that adds the percentage-point change to tweets that only mention the relative change. Thanks to Fabian Tamp for pointing this out!</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Jumping in the deep end with Workman]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I last documented my experience with the Workman keyboard layout in July. At the time I could type at a little over 50 wpm using it. I’d just made it the main keyboard layout on my personal computer, but hadn’t found a way to apply the layout to all programs. By practicing daily, I hoped to improve to a point where I’d feel comfortable using Workman at work too.</p>
<p>That didn’t really pan out. I quit regular typing practice a couple of weeks after publishing that post. I kept using Workman on my own computer, but would switch back to QWERTY when coding outside of work. And I never got around to trying it on my work computer. My goal to use Workman everywhere ended up on the back burner for a couple of months.</p>
<p>Until the end of September. I took a week off to <a href="/blog/tags/rc-mini-7-2020">participate in a Recurse Center mini-batch</a> and decided to use the time to practice Workman. I wouldn’t use QWERTY for anything, not even coding. (Luckily, the weekend before RC, I found out how to enable Workman system-wide on Ubuntu! Note to self: Post the solution. If it was non-obvious to me, it’s non-obvious to someone else.)</p>
<p>That week, I spent more time than I would have liked fiddling with my <code>.vimrc</code>. I wanted to set up Vim to use QWERTY key locations in normal mode and Workman locations in insert mode, so my muscle memory wouldn’t immediately become useless. I installed a plugin but found a couple of bugs. I fixed one of them but lost patience with the other, so I started writing my own key mapping. For unknown reasons it didn’t work consistently. At this point, I was pretty tired of writing Vimscript. Plus, I was unconsciously using Workman key locations in normal mode half the time anyway. I decided to get rid of the key mapping and go cold turkey.</p>
<p>At the start, I made a lot of mistakes while inputting Vim commands and felt like I was coding much more slowly than before. Pairing was especially painful. It’s no fun to feel like you’re slowing down yourself <em>and</em> another person. In hindsight, though, I think I made a great decision! By the end of the week, I felt confident enough to start using Workman at work and haven’t looked back.</p>
<p>As a side effect, I’m no longer able to touch-type QWERTY. At least I think that’s true: I haven’t tried for more than a minute or two. But I’m not unhappy about it. I can still type 65-70 wpm in a typing test. That’s 20-30 wpm slower than QWERTY, but it’s high enough that it doesn’t seem to have an impact on my programming speed. So much of coding is selecting the right option from the autocomplete dropdown anyway.</p>
<p>I do miss the extra speed when writing a blog post or messaging someone, though. I don’t quite feel like I type at the speed of thought (although I don’t think I ever did). But with daily real-world practice I expect to eventually reach a typing speed I’m happy with.</p>
<p>I intended to title this post “Mastering Workman”, but I don't think I’ve reached mastery yet. Hopefully next time I report back I’ll feel that way!</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Understanding quine-central: the source code]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is an explanation of the source code of <a href="https://github.com/dpiponi/quine-central"><code>quine-central</code></a>, a program that produces quine loops. A quine is a program that prints its own source code. A quine loop is an extension of the same concept to multiple programs. Each program prints the source code of the next program in the loop. If you follow the loop far enough, you get back to the program you started with!</p>
<p>This post's prequel (linked in the left arrow above this post) explains why the programs generated by <code>quine-central</code> are quine loops. This post mainly explains how <code>quine-central</code> generates those programs. It might be useful to read the sequel before reading this post, to understand the motivation behind some of the parts of this code. I've still tried to include that context where necessary.</p>
<p><code>quine-central</code> generates a quine loop containing programs in eleven different languages. For simplicity, this article usually only includes the code for generating programs in three languages: Haskell, JavaScript, and Racket.</p>
<p>First we define a type with an option for each language we want to generate quines for.</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">data Languages = Haskell
               | Javascript
               | Racket
               | ...
</code></pre>
<p>Each program in the quine loop has two lines. The first line always defines a function <code>q</code> and the second line always calls that function. Let's start by generating the code for the second line of the output program, the call to <code>q</code>. In some languages we need to wrap this call in a main method. In others we can leave it at the top level.</p>
<p><code>defn</code> returns the portion of the second line before the arguments list, <code>endDefn</code> the portion after.</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">-- Start the main part of program
defn Haskell = "main = q \""
defn Javascript  = "q(\""
defn Racket  = "(q \""
...

-- End main part of program
endDefn Haskell = "\""
endDefn Javascript   = "\");"
endDefn Racket   = "\")"
...
</code></pre>
<p>Note that each result of <code>defn</code> ends in a quotation mark while each result of <code>endDefn</code> starts with one. That's because each argument passed to <code>q</code> in the generated code is a string.</p>
<p>To separate each pair of arguments, we need a close quotation mark to mark the end of the first argument, the character that separates function arguments (a comma in most languages, a space in others), and an open quotation mark to mark the beginning of the next argument.</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">divider Haskell = "\" \""
divider Javascript  = "\",\""
divider Racket  = "\" \""
...
</code></pre>
<p><code>driver</code> takes a language and a list of arguments, then generates the second line of the output program for that language. For example, <code>driver Haskell ["foo", "bar", "quux"]</code> returns a string containing <code>main = q "foo" "bar" "quux"</code>, <code>driver Javascript ["a", "b", "c", "d"]</code> one containing <code>"q("a", "b", "c", "d")</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">driver l args = defn l ++
                intercalate (divider l) args ++
                endDefn l
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's generate the first line of the output program, the definition of <code>q</code>. In all languages except Perl, which has implicit function arguments, we'll name <code>q</code>'s arguments <code>a0</code>, <code>a1</code>, ... <code>a{n-1}</code> (where <code>{n-1}</code> is replaced with the number <code>n - 1</code>, one less than the number of languages in the loop).</p>
<p>The helper function <code>paramList'</code> takes the numbers <code>[0..n-1]</code> that should be added to the end of each argument, then builds an argument list for the variables <code>a0</code> to <code>a{n-1}</code> that we'll later insert into a definition of <code>q</code>. For example, <code>paramList Haskell 3 = "a0 a1 a2"</code> and <code>paramList Javascript 5</code> = <code>a0,a1,a2,a3,a4</code>. In C and Java we must explicitly specify that each argument is a string.</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">paramList' Haskell = intercalate " " . map (\n -> "a" ++ show n)
paramList' Javascript = intercalate "," . map (\n -> "a" ++ show n)
paramList' Racket  = intercalate " " . map (\n -> "a" ++ show n)
paramList' C       = intercalate "," . map (\n -> "char *a" ++ show n)
...

-- Generate a list or arguments to a function such as "a0,a1,..."
paramList Perl _ = ""
paramList lang n = paramList' lang [0..n-1]
</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to take a detour. Let's look at the program that a simplified version of <code>quine-central</code> produces when Haskell is the only language in the loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">q a0=putStrLn $ a0++"\nmain = q \""++a0++"\""
main = q "q a0=putStrLn $ a0++"\nmain = q \""++a0++"\"""
</code></pre>
<p>This program won't compile because the string passed to <code>q</code> on the second line contains unescaped double quotes. Let's escape them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">q a0=putStrLn $ a0++"\nmain = q \""++a0++"\""
main = q "q a0=putStrLn $ a0++\"\nmain = q \\\"\"++a0++\"\\\"\""
</code></pre>
<p>We could get <code>quine-central</code> to escape them for us. The problem is that this is no longer a quine. It prints:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">q a0=putStrLn $ a0++"
main = q \""++a0++"\""
main = q "q a0=putStrLn $ a0++"
main = q \""++a0++"\"""
</code></pre>
<p>Looks like we might need to replace <code>\n</code> with <code>\\n</code> on the second line. We don't want to print a real newline, just <code>\n</code>. If we make that change, the program prints:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">q a0=putStrLn $ a0++"\nmain = q \""++a0++"\""
main = q "q a0=putStrLn $ a0++"\nmain = q \""++a0++"\"""
</code></pre>
<p>Still not a quine! The first line of the output and source code are the same, but the second line lost most of its escaping.</p>
<p>The problem is that, when <code>q</code> prints <code>a0</code> for the second time, it doesn't re-escape the characters that were escaped on the second line of the original program. We could probably handle this by adding character escaping logic for each language, but I suspect the problem becomes even more complicated with multiple languages. For example, the Perl program wraps the arguments passed to <code>q</code> in single quotes. This means that we <em>don't</em> need to escape double quotes when printing that string in from other languages.</p>
<p><code>quine-central</code>'s author found a simpler solution: Don't print any characters that need to be escaped in the first place. Instead, <code>quine-central</code> prints code that builds a string by converting the ASCII codes for the characters in the string into characters, then joining those characters together. The <code>sequenceFromString</code> function generates this code. For example, <code>sequenceFromString Haskell "Hello, world\n" = "map toEnum [72,101,108,108,111,44,32,119,111,114,108,100,10]"</code>. Note how the result of <code>sequenceFromString</code> doesn't contain any characters that have to be escaped.</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">-- Generate code to emit individual characters comprising string.
-- Used to eliminate escape character issues.
sequenceFromString Haskell s = "map toEnum [" ++ (intercalate "," $
    map (\c -> show (fromEnum c)) s) ++ "]"
sequenceFromString Javascript s = "process.stdout.write(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, [" ++
    (intercalate "," $ map (\c -> show (fromEnum c)) s) ++
    "]));"
sequenceFromString Racket s = "(display (bytes " ++
    (intercalate " " $ map (\c -> show (fromEnum c)) s) ++ "))"
...
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's build the body of <code>q</code>. <code>paramList</code> generated a list of parameters for <code>q</code>, called <code>a0</code> to <code>a{n-1}</code>. <code>arg</code> generates a string that references a given argument to <code>q</code>. In some languages, it generates a statement that prints <code>q</code>. In others, it just generates the variable name, because <code>q</code> will concatenate the variable's value to other strings before printing it. For example, <code>arg Javascript 3 = "process.stdout.write(a3)"</code>, while <code>arg Haskell 0 = "a0"</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">-- Print the nth argument to a function
arg Haskell n = "a" ++ show n
arg Javascript n  = "process.stdout.write(a" ++ show n ++ ");"
arg Racket n  = "(display a" ++ show n ++ ")"
...
</code></pre>
<p><code>argDivide</code> creates a string representing some code in the language specified by its first argument. The code is a string containing the function argument separator in the language specified by its second argument. In languages where <code>sequenceFromString</code> generates code to print its argument, <code>argDivide</code> doesn't wrap the result of <code>sequenceFromString</code> in string concatenation operators, and does otherwise.</p>
<p>For example, consider <code>argDivide Haskell Javascript</code>. <code>divider Javascript = "\",\""</code> because, in JavaScript, we separate arguments passed to a function with commas. The quotation marks are to wrap the arguments in quotation marks, to make them strings. <code>sequenceFromString Haskell "\",\"" = "map toEnum [34,44,34]"</code>, so <code>argDivide Haskell Javascript = "++map toEnum [34,44,34]++"</code>. Note how, because of <code>sequenceFromString</code>, <code>"++map toEnum [34,44,34]++"</code> contains no characters that have to be escaped in a Haskell string.</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">argDivide Haskell l = "++" ++
                      sequenceFromString Haskell (divider l) ++
                      "++"
argDivide Javascript l = sequenceFromString Javascript (divider l)
argDivide Racket l  = sequenceFromString Racket (divider l)
...
</code></pre>
<p><code>argList</code> uses <code>arg</code> and <code>argDivide</code> to generate code in <code>lang1</code> that prints the arguments to a call to <code>q</code> in <code>lang2</code>. For example, <code>argList Haskell Javascript 3 = "a1++map toEnum [34,44,34]++a2++map toEnum [34,44,34]++a0"</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">argList lang1 lang2 n = intercalate (argDivide lang1 lang2) $
    map (arg lang1) ([1..n-1] ++ [0])
</code></pre>
<p><code>fromTo</code> prints the definition of <code>q</code> in the first language it's given. This <code>q</code> prints <code>a0</code>, then the second line of the quine program in the language <code>l</code> (<code>defn l</code>, then <code>argList _ l n</code>, then <code>endDefn l</code>). For example, <code>fromTo 3 Haskell Javascript = "q a0 a1 a2=putStrLn $ a0++map toEnum [10,114,40,34]++a1++map toEnum [34,44,34]++a2++map toEnum [34,44,34]++a0++map toEnum [34,41,59]"</code>. If we called this definition of <code>q</code> on "foo", "bar", and "quux", it would print:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">foo
q("bar","quux","foo");
</code></pre>
<p>This looks a lot like the JavaScript program in the quine loop!</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">fromTo n Haskell l = "q " ++ paramList Haskell n ++
                     "=putStrLn $ a0++" ++
                     sequenceFromString Haskell ("\n" ++ defn l) ++
                     "++" ++
                     argList Haskell l n ++
                     "++" ++ sequenceFromString Haskell (endDefn l)
fromTo n Javascript l = "function q(" ++
                        paramList Javascript n ++ ") {" ++
                        "process.stdout.write(a0);" ++
                        sequenceFromString Javascript ("\n" ++ defn l) ++
                        argList Javascript l n ++
                        sequenceFromString Javascript (endDefn l ++ "\n") ++
                        "};"
fromTo n Racket l = "(define (q " ++
                    paramList Racket n ++
                    ") (begin " ++
                    "(display a0)" ++
                    sequenceFromString Racket ("\n" ++ defn l) ++
                    argList Racket l n ++
                    sequenceFromString Racket (endDefn l ++ "\n") ++
                    "))"
...
</code></pre>
<p>Almost there. We declare a list of the languages we want to cycle through:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">langs = [ Haskell
        , Ruby
        , Perl
        , C
        , Python
        , Java
        , Rust
        , OCaml
        , Swift
        , Racket
        , Javascript
        ]
</code></pre>
<p>And now the magic. <code>langs'</code> contains an infinite list of the selected languages repeating over and over. First, we use <code>fromTo</code> to print a definition of <code>q</code> in the first language that, when called, prints a quine loop program in the second language. Then, we use <code>driver</code> to print the second line of the program, the call to <code>q</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>zipWith (fromTo n) ...</code> expression determines the arguments passed to <code>q</code>. It reduces to a list where the first element is <code>fromTo n</code> called on the second and third language, then on the third and fourth language, all the way back around to the last and first language. Recall that <code>fromTo</code> prints a definition of <code>q</code> in the first language passed to it. That definition, when called, prints a quine program in the second language passed to <code>fromTo</code>. So the arguments to <code>driver</code>, and therefore to the call to <code>q</code>, are:</p>
<ol>
<li>A definition of <code>q</code> in the second language that prints a quine loop program in the third language</li>
<li>A definition of <code>q</code> in the third language that prints a quine loop program in the third language</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>A definition of <code>q</code> in the last language that prints a quine loop program in the first language</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-hs">main = do
    let n = length langs
    let langs' = cycle langs
    putStrLn $ fromTo n (head langs') (head (tail langs'))
    putStrLn $ driver (head langs') $
      zipWith (fromTo n)
        (take n (tail langs')) (tail (tail langs'))
</code></pre>
<p>Let's see why this works by considering a simpler case, when <code>langs = [Haskell, Javascript, Racket]</code>. <code>main</code> prints a quine loop program in Haskell that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">q a0 a1 a2=putStrLn $ a0++map toEnum [10,114,40,34]++a1++map toEnum [34,44,34]++a2++map toEnum [34,44,34]++a0++map toEnum [34,41,59]
main = q "{definition of `q` in JavaScript}" "{definition of `q` in Racket}" "{definition of `q` in Haskell}"
</code></pre>
<p>This Haskell program prints the following JavaScript program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">{definition of `q` in JavaScript}
q("{definition of `q` in Racket}","{definition of `q` in Haskell}","{definition of `q` in JavaScript}");
</code></pre>
<p>Recall that <code>q</code> is always defined to print its first argument, then a call to <code>q</code> with arguments rotated one to the left. Therefore this prints the following Racket program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-racket">{definition of `q` in Racket}
(q "{definition of `q` in Haskell}" "{definition of `q` in JavaScript}" "{definition of `q` in Racket}")
</code></pre>
<p>Which prints a Haskell program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">{definition of `q` in Haskell}
main = q "{definition of `q` in JavaScript}" "{definition of `q` in Racket}" "{definition of `q` in Haskell}"
</code></pre>
<p>But the definition of <code>q</code> in Haskell is just the first line of the generated Haskell program, closing the loop.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[RC day 5]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday went so well I forgot to post about it! I started early, spending an hour trying to explain how <a href="https://github.com/dpiponi/quine-central"><code>quine-central</code></a> handles character escaping. Then I paired with a batchmate on <a href="https://github.com/tbroadley/narrated-diffs">Narrated Diffs</a> (fka Literate Diffs), which was extremely helpful. Together we had a brainstorm for improvements to the project, selected the ones necessary for an MLP (minimum loveable product), then implemented a feature (the ability to build a narrated diff from a GitHub PR URL).</p>
<p>Without that session I don’t think Narrated Diffs would be where it is now: <a href="https://narrated-diffs.thomasbroadley.com">a tool that you can actually use!</a> Paste a Git diff or a GitHub PR URL, then click “Narrate that diff!”. You can then reorder the diff’s chunks and add comments to them. When you’re done, copy the URL and send it to your reviewers. Tell a story with your PR and hopefully they’ll find it easier to review.</p>
<p>After that pairing session, I spent the rest of the day getting Narrated Diffs to an MLP. I created a Postgres database on my computer and got the backend to store diffs in it. Then I hosted the frontend and backend on a VPS, which took a while. I’ll post soon explaining in more depth the tech stack the project uses.</p>
<p>I wrapped up the day with technical talks. These are five-minute presentations by Recursers about projects they’ve been working on. First, a few RC staff members gave a presentation on <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules">RC’s four social rules</a>, complete with demonstrations and audience participation. Then I talked about what I’d learned about code review pain points this week and gave a demo of Narrative Diffs. I wish I’d spent more time preparing for my talk, oh well!</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the talks that others gave. One Recurser used Python’s <code>html.parser</code> module to solve FizzBuzz by scraping Answers.com for questions like, “Is 17 divisible by 5?” Another added tail recursion to a Python program by modifying its bytecode (as the presenter said, “Python has bytecode??”). The highlight was when an alumni used computer voice control software called <a href="https://talonvoice.com/">Talon</a> to live-code FizzBuzz right in front of us!</p>
<p>It’s been a really good week. I’m quite put out that it’s over. I’ll publish a return statement (RC’s cute term for a reflection on your time there) in the next few days.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[RC day 4]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I spent a lot of the day trying to understand how <a href="https://github.com/dpiponi/quine-central"><code>quine-central</code></a> works. I think I got there! I published <a href="../understanding-quine-central-quine-loops">a post</a> explaining how the programs generated by <code>quine-central</code> work and I’ve started one that summarizes how <code>quine-central</code> generates them.</p>
<p>Along the way I made a few small improvements to my blog-generating software. I decided I much preferred the blogchain navigation I’d added over simply linking to a page with all posts under a tag, so I converted all posts with tags to use the former. (See the “RC Mini 7, 2020” above this post for an example.)</p>
<p>In the morning I had another coffee chat and one last discussion about code review, then started synthesizing the feedback from all those discussions. I hope to present my findings at the technical talks at the end of the day tomorrow.</p>
<p>Finally, I paired again on <a href="https://github.com/stephen/cssc"><code>cssc</code></a>. We added support for reducing one species of multi-term <code>calc</code> expression, ones like <code>calc(100% - 10px - 10px)</code> that have multiple terms with the same units next to each other. We might pair again tomorrow to get <code>cssc</code> to handle expressions like <code>calc(100px - 10% - 10px)</code> where the terms with the same units are separated.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’ll also pair on Literate Diffs, work on a tech talk, and wrap up that second blog post on <code>quine-central</code>. It’s hard to believe tomorrow’s the last day of my batch. I’m going to get as much as I can out of my remaining time, then think about how I’d like to continue being a part in the RC community afterwards.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Understanding quine-central: how do quine loops work?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday another Recurser introduced me to <a href="https://github.com/dpiponi/quine-central"><code>quine-central</code></a>, which is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A] Haskell program that generates a Haskell program that prints out a Perl program that prints out a Python program that prints out a Ruby program that prints out a C program that prints out a Java program that prints out a Rust program that prints out an OCaml program that prints out a Swift program that prints out a Racket program that prints out a Javascript program that prints out the first Haskell program generated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“How the hell does that work?” I thought to myself. Maybe you’re thinking that too, so here’s my attempt at an explanation.</p>
<p><code>quine-central</code> can produce quine loops of any length, so let’s first think about a loop of three programming languages: Haskell, Ruby, and C. In this case, <code>quine-central</code> prints a Haskell program that prints a Ruby program that prints a C program that prints the first Haskell program generated.</p>
<p class="image image-centered">
  <img src="/blog/understanding-quine-central-quine-loops/loop.jpg" alt="A loop of languages, going from Haskell to Ruby to C and back to Haskell.">
</p>
<p>The generated Haskell program has two lines. The first line defines a function called <code>q</code> that takes three arguments. <code>q</code> builds and returns a string that contains its first argument, then a newline, and finally some Ruby code that calls a function called <code>q</code>. This call to <code>q</code> in Ruby takes the same arguments but rotated one position to the left. That is, it takes the second argument to the Haskell <code>q</code>, then the third, then the first.</p>
<p class="image">
  <img src="/blog/understanding-quine-central-quine-loops/first-line.jpg" alt="A diagram explaining q&#x27;s implementation in Haskell. q takes three arguments: a0, a1, and a2. q returns a0 concatenated with a newline, then the string q(&#x22;, then a1, then the string &#x22;,&#x22;, then a2, then the string &#x22;,&#x22;, then a0, and finally the string &#x22;). Its output is the value of a0 on the first line, then a call to q in Ruby with the arguments a1, a2, and a0 on the second line.">
</p>
<p>In the actual output, <code>{a0}</code> is replaced with the value of <code>a0</code>. Same goes for the other variables. Also, this isn’t quite the actual code. I simplified it a little for demonstration purposes.</p>
<p>The generated Haskell program's second line is a main method that calls the function <code>q</code> defined on the first line and prints the result. Each argument passed to <code>q</code> is the source code for a definition of <code>q</code> in a language in the loop. The first argument is a definition of <code>q</code> in Ruby, the second in C, the last in Haskell.</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">main = putStrLn $ q "{Ruby    definition of q}"
                    "{C       definition of q}"
                    "{Haskell definition of q}"
</code></pre>
<p>In all of these definitions, <code>q</code> does the same thing as it does in the Haskell program. It prints its first argument, then prints a call to a function called <code>q</code>, but in the next language in the loop. It also rotates its arguments one position to the left before printing them.</p>
<p>When the program is run, <code>q</code> starts by printing its first argument, which is a declaration of <code>q</code> in Ruby. Then, it prints a call to <code>q</code> in Ruby. The arguments to this call are the second, third, and first arguments passed to <code>q</code> in the Haskell program, which are definitions of <code>q</code> in C, Haskell, and Ruby respectively.</p>
<p>The output of the Haskell program is a Ruby program with a very similar structure. Both have two lines. Both declare a function <code>q</code> on the first line. <code>q</code> does the same thing in both programs. And both call <code>q</code> on the second line, passing in definitions of <code>q</code> for the rest of the loop.</p>
<p>When this Ruby program is run, it in turn prints a C program with the same structure. And that C program in turn prints a Haskell program with the same structure. In fact, it prints the original Haskell program, closing the loop.</p>
<p>In the next post, I’ll discuss how <code>quine-central</code> generates these programs in the first place. We’ll also do away with some of the simplifications I made to the programs in this post and look at how <code>quine-central</code> handles the problems posed by string escaping.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[RC day 3]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I started the day by (surprise, surprise) fiddling with my <code>.vimrc</code>. I decided to discard <a href="https://github.com/nicwest/vim-workman"><code>vim-workman</code></a> and try out a more minimal set of key remappings, but I ran into problems with those too. Eventually I realized I was spending too much time on this and decided to get rid of all rebindings. So far it’s going OK! I’m working much more slowly than usual and making lots of mistakes (although fewer by the end of the day). I’ll try this approach for the rest of the week, with the goal of switching to Workman on my work computer next week.</p>
<p>I then discussed code review pain points with another current Recurser. He told me about some of the processes his company’s put in place to make sure PRs get reviewed by the right person. He also encouraged me to share the knowledge I’ve gathered from my discussions this week, either in a blog post or in a technical talk on Friday. I’ll likely do both, so watch this space!</p>
<p>Afterward, I spent some time polishing my <a href="https://github.com/tbroadley/literate-diffs">Literate Diffs</a> prototype, which you can now test out <a href="https://thomasbroadley.com/literate-diffs/">here</a>. Just paste in a Git diff (e.g. <a href="https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/tbroadley/spellchecker-cli/pull/59.diff">this one</a>), then annotate and rearrange the chunks to your heart’s content. I also got feedback on the prototype from those I’ve discussed code review with this week.</p>
<p>Later in the day, I had another coffee chat with a current Recurser. We talked about our lives before RC, swapped our favourite technical articles, and went back and forth over the benefits and disadvantages of type safety in certain contexts. (My coffee chat partner had written some SVG-generating Elixir code and found it clunky to have to wrap an opacity percentage like 0.5 in an <code>Opacity</code> type before passing the result to an <code>opacity</code> function. I think it’s clunky too, for little gain.)</p>
<p>Finally, I spent a good chunk of the day pairing on changes to <a href="https://github.com/stephen/cssc"><code>cssc</code></a>, a CSS compiler written in Go, with its creator. Specifically, we refactored the code that simplifies <code>calc</code> expressions containing constants (e.g. <code>calc(2px + 2px)</code>) and discussed ways to fix a bug in that code.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I plan to pair more on <code>cssc</code>, have another coffee chat and a discussion about code review, and digest the notes I’ve taken from those discussions so far. After that I’m not sure! I could see myself working on Literate Diffs more, returning to Cryptopals, or picking up something new.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[RC day 2]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
  I started the day by adding three new plugins to my Vim setup, after learning about them from a thread on RC’s Zulip:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim"><code>coc.nvim</code></a> (language-specific autocomplete and jump to definition)
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim"><code>fzf.vim</code></a> (fuzzy search for anything, but I’m only using it to open files right now)
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive"><code>fugitive.vim</code></a> (Git commands)
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  That took most of the morning, perhaps more time than I should have spent on it. I did learn about Vimscript and worked around one gotcha that’s good material for another post.
</p>

<p>
  Late in the morning I caught the end of daily check-ins. Participants take turns briefly explaining what they worked on yesterday and what they’re working on today. I’ll definitely be attending the entire meeting tomorrow: It was a great way to hear about interesting projects that others are working on. I also found it handy to be able to reference my “RC day 1” post while giving my check-in.
</p>

<p>
  After lunch I attended a workshop on pair programming. I’ve paired quite a bit before but still learned something new. For example, one benefit of pairing I hadn’t considered was that it’s harder to get distracted for minutes by social media when pairing. (I do still find myself getting distracted for 30 seconds at a time by Slack. Something for me to work on.)
</p>

<p>
  I also picked up a few new pairing tips:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Swap roles every 8-15 minutes (the driver becomes the navigator and vice versa)
  </li>

  <li>
    Take short breaks every so often
  </li>

  <li>
    Don’t pair on a task that’s trivial for both people
  </li>

  <li>
    Focus on transferring and receiving knowledge instead of achieving a result in a set amount of time
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  We then put those tips into practice by pairing with other Recursers to implement the Game of Life.
</p>

<p>
  After the workshop, I had a coffee chat with someone who’s been at RC for a few weeks already. She gave me some good advice: Even though my time at RC is flying by, the experience doesn’t end along with my batch. I can still attend study groups and other events after this week. And I’m already thinking about coming back for a six- or twelve-week batch.

<p>
  Early in the day, I posted on Zulip asking to chat with people about their experiences with code review. I hoped to figure out whether <a href="https://github.com/tbroadley/literate-diffs">Literate Diffs</a> solves a real problem. A few people expressed interest and I spoke with a couple of them late this afternoon. One had already noticed the exact problem that Literate Diffs aims to solve. The other had already solved the problem a different way at his company. They found it harder to build systems for determining who should review which PRs. Definitely food for thought.
</p>

<p>
  Somewhere along the way, I started a Google Doc containing interesting links that others had shared with me or posted on Zulip. Currently it contains Wikipedia articles, blog posts, and Amazon pages for a few books. After this week I’ll run through it and consolidate that knowledge somehow.
</p>

<p>
  I spent longer than I intended catching up on my RSS feed. I feel bad about the lost productivity, but maybe my brain needed the break. I’ll push myself a little harder tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
  Speaking of tomorrow! In the morning, I want to come up with a plan of attack for Literate Diffs and start executing against it. Right now, the best strategy seems to be fleshing out my old React prototype, then asking people to play around with it. I also want to pair again—I’ve signed up for a session with a Zulip bot that matches you with other people looking for pairing partners. If there’s time, I’ll try to get <a href="https://github.com/nicwest/vim-workman"><code>vim-workman</code></a> to play nice with macros.
</p>

<p>
  P.S. Writing this blog post made me realize how annoying it is to write HTML without macros. Tomorrow I'll also look at adding Markdown support to my blog generator.
</p>

            <title><![CDATA[RC day 1]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
  RC began with a tour of <a href="https://www.recurse.com/virtual-rc">Virtual RC</a>, an online space that emulates the physical RC experience with all its serendipitous conversations. Then I attended talks by RC employees about the program and how to get the most out of it. Finally we broke into small groups and I briefly met a few other current attendees.
</p>

<p>
  I found a study group following <a href="https://cryptopals.com/">Cryptopals</a>, a series of programming challenges that introduce you to real-world cryptography and breaking said crypto. I didn’t attend the group, but I solved the first three challenges using Clojure. I’ve never programmed in that language and haven’t used a Lisp in a while, so it took time to get through them. I might work on the problems more but probably not in Clojure. I like Lispy syntax but missed static types and couldn’t find high-quality documentation for the standard library.
</p>

<p>
  After that I looked at an old project called <a href="https://github.com/tbroadley/literate-diffs">Literate Diffs</a>. The pitch is literate programming for Git diffs. PR authors should be able to reorder chunks in their PRs and add commentary around them. I think this idea has the potential to make code review a lot easier for reviewers (with a little investment from authors). I might resurrect that project this week or tackle the idea from a different direction (a file format? A browser extension for GitHub and similar sites?).
</p>

<p>
  Honestly it was a slow day! <a href="/blog/tags/workman">I’m switching from QWERTY to Workman</a> and still don’t have the hang of using Vim with this new layout. I’m using a package called <a href="https://github.com/nicwest/vim-workman"><code>vim-workman</code></a> to let me use my QWERTY muscle memory in normal mode, which is helping a lot. In fact, this afternoon, I opened a couple of PRs on that repo. One was a documentation improvement, the second a fix for an issue. I filed another issue that I might take a crack at solving tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
  I didn’t pair with anyone today. To hit that goal for the rest of the week, I’m going to have to put myself out there more than I did today. But working on <code>vim-workman</code> gave me some ideas for what to do this week. Maybe I can build some tools to make myself more productive as a programmer, then do a presentation on them at the end of the week. Or even present on my Workman journey and the software I’ve used to get here.
</p>

            <title><![CDATA[My goals for RC]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
This week I’m participating in a <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> mini-batch. RC had been on my radar for a while, but an old coworker of mine encouraged me to apply recently. Here are my goals for the week.
</p>

<h2>
  Blog everyday
</h2>

<p>
  I haven’t blogged as much as I’d like to in the past few months. RC is a good opportunity to get back into the habit. I’ll follow the example of a few folks I’ve seen on RC’s <a href="https://blaggregator.recurse.com/about/">Blaggregator</a> and post daily about what I’ve been working on. It seems like a good way to stay accountable to myself, celebrate my progress, and build memories of my time at RC.
</p>

<h2>
  Pair everyday
</h2>

<p>
  I’ve found out that I prefer coding alone and getting as little feedback as necessary, partly because I don’t take criticism well. I think this is a mistake. I could produce higher-quality work and grow more quickly if I collaborated more. So this week I’m going to do at least one pairing session with another Recurser per day. Maybe if I pair more regularly I’ll internalize that it’s more productive than working alone.
</p>

<h2>
  Do a talk
</h2>

<p>
  I found out that Recursers give talks on technical subjects every Friday evening. I’m going to give one to practice public speaking and to encourage myself to dive deeply into at least one topic while I’m at RC.
</p>

<h2>
  Have fun!
</h2>

<p>
  Modulo the goals above, I won’t force myself to do anything I don’t enjoy. Instead I’m going to follow my nose, work on things that interest me, and switch it up if I’m not having fun. This week I want to nurture my curiosity about computer science and my intrinsic motivation to program. If I start something interesting and give up halfway through, I can always pick it back up after RC.
</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Brushing my teeth]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
  For a long time, my poor oral health has frustrated me and stressed me out. My attitude has been that, since I brush and floss regularly, it doesn’t make sense that my gums are inflamed and receding.
</p>

<p>
  I’ve realized that, when I say it doesn’t make sense, I mean it’s unfair. I put effort into oral hygiene and I don’t get the outcomes that my dentist promised. But fairness doesn’t matter. What matters is whether my teeth are healthy or not.
</p>

<p>
  So I’m committing to taking care of my mouth in ways that actually keep it healthy. (For example, I don’t brush my teeth methodically, which likely contributes to tartar build-up. Mindfulness while brushing is the solution.) And I’ll try to avoid this in other areas of my life. No more feeling sorry for myself while forgetting about the reality of the situation!

            <title><![CDATA[PipedInputStream and PipedOutputStream gotchas]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
  To do I/O in Java, you read from InputStreams and write to OutputStreams. Sometimes you want to connect the output of an OutputStream to the input of an InputStream. In my case, I wanted to upload a CSV (generated by writing to a given OutputStream) to Amazon S3 (using a class reading from an InputStream).
</p>

<p>
  I solved this problem using a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PipedInputStream.html">PipedInputStream</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PipedOutputStream.html">PipedOutputStream</a>. Reading from a PipedInputStream returns bytes written to the connected PipedOutputStream. Here was the Kotlin code I ended up with:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">// Create a PipedInputStream; automatically close it at the end of
// the lambda
PipedInputStream().use { inputStream ->

  // Run the given lambda in a new thread
  thread {

    // Create a PipedOutputStream and connect it to the
    // PipedInputStream; automatically close it at the end of the
    // lambda
    PipedOutputStream(inputStream).use { outputStream ->
      generateCsv(outputStream)
    }
  }

  uploadToS3(inputStream)
}</code></pre>

<p>
  These classes come with a couple of gotchas. First, you should write to the PipedOutputStream and read from the PipedInputStream on separate threads. (Each class’s documentation clearly states this, so this isn’t so much a gotcha as a case of me not reading the docs closely enough.) If you read and write on the same thread, you might encounter a deadlock.
</p>

<p>
  The deadlock’s symptoms depend on whether your single-threaded code reads before it writes or vice versa. If it reads from the PipedInputStream first, it’ll hang forever waiting for something to write to the PipedOutputStream. However, if it writes to the PipedOutputStream first, you might not see any symptoms initially. In my case, I wrote a passing test that generated a small CSV and uploaded it to an S3 mock. However, when the code ran in production, it generated part of the CSV, then looped forever.
</p>

<p>
  The problem is buffering. PipedInputStreams buffer 1,024 bytes by default. Like I did, you might also wrap the former in a BufferedReader or the latter in a BufferedWriter, which default to using 8,192-byte buffers. As long as the data you write fit into the largest buffer in the stream, you won’t notice any problems. Writing won’t block because the buffer can hold all the written bytes. Then the PipedInputStream can read all the data you wrote. But as soon as you write enough data to fill the buffer, your write will block and you’ll encounter a deadlock.
</p>

<p>
  As the code above demonstrates, the solution is to read on one thread and write on another. That way, reading and writing can block without preventing the other operation from making progress.
</p>

<p>
  After realizing this, I encountered the second gotcha. My code initially called <code>generateCsv</code> on the main thread and <code>uploadToS3</code> on the thread created by <code>thread</code>. The issue is that, when <code>generateCsv</code> finishes, the main thread returns from the <code>use</code> block associated with the PipedInputStream. This closes the PipedInputStream even if <code>uploadToS3</code> is in the middle of reading from it. In my case, I noticed that the CSV file written to the S3 mock was truncated.
</p>

<p>
  To solve this problem, read on the main thread and write on the newly-created thread. This way, the PipedInputStream doesn’t close until <code>uploadToS3</code> has read everything from it.
</p>

<p>
  It took me a few hours to figure out what are in retrospect a couple of simple mistakes. My main takeaway is that I need to read documentation more carefully. I should also spend more time getting to know Java’s I/O primitives better.
</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Grayscale screens]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
  About a year ago I noticed that a coworker of mine had configured his phone’s screen to display everything in grayscale. He told me his goal was to make the screen less interesting to look at, to reduce the temptation to spend a lot of time looking at it. That convinced me to also switch my phone to grayscale.
</p>

<p>
  A year in, I’m not sure if the change has had much effect. I still spend a lot of time on my phone. I’ve had more success reducing that amount of time by disabling or uninstalling apps I spend a lot of time on. But whenever I disable grayscale mode, I’m shocked by how vibrant and interesting the colours are, so I think it’s had at least a small impact.
</p>

<p>
  Today I installed <a href="https://github.com/laerne/desaturate_all"><code>desaturate_all</code></a>, a Gnome extension that enables grayscale mode for Ubuntu. I suppose my goal is the same: to make my laptop less interesting to look at. Mainly I hope I’ll interact differently with sites like Reddit. If I make their content less flashy and visually interesting, maybe I’ll spend less time on them.
</p>

<p>
  I’ve also considered purchasing a phone or a monitor with an e-ink screen. These screens both enforce grayscale (although colour e-ink displays are also available) and don’t strain the eyes as much as LCDs. I considered purchasing a Kingrow K1 e-ink smartphone, but was deterred by the lack of Google Play support and the difficulty of getting it shipped to Canada. Searching again, the Hisense A5 looks like a more promising option that I’ll have to investigate further.

            <title><![CDATA[Using Workman]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
  On May 12, I completed my first lessons using the <a href="https://workmanlayout.org/">Workman keyboard layout</a> on <a href="https://www.keybr.com/">Keybr</a>. On May 25, I started practicing seriously, spending 15 minutes a day each day from then until June 11. By June 9 I’d learned all the new layout’s letter keys.
</p>

<p>
  As I thought I might in my last post, on June 13, I started practicing using <a href="https://www.typingclub.com">TypingClub</a> instead of Keybr. I hoped that typing real words and sentences only would help me build word-level muscle memory faster. TypingClub also trains me on capital letters and punctuation. Keybr can train you on these too, and more intensely than TypingClub: Every word can be capitalized or end with punctuation. However I thought I’d learn these keys more quickly by using them in real-world contexts.
</p>

<p class="image">
  <img src="/blog/using-workman/typingclub-lesson.jpg" alt="A screenshot of a TypingClub lesson about African languages. The first two sentences of the passage are visible. The first sentence has already been typed. Letters typed correctly the first time are highlighted in green, those typed incorrectly and then correctly in yellow. A bar at the bottom shows my progress through the lesson.">
</p>

<p>
  TypingClub is an OK resource for those learning to type. It offers a full course in touch-typing but I skipped ahead to its advanced lessons, which involve typing a three-to-five-sentence biography of a person or summary of a concept. The website’s clearly aimed towards students: The lessons use a middle- or high-school reading level and some are about plagiarism and online bullying. It’s also focused on Western culture, with many lessons on American historical figures, authors, and politics. I found the lesson UI, which shows how fast you type each word and your speed and accuracy for the current lesson, pretty distracting and hid most of these UI elements using uBlock Origin. Overall TypingClub is useful but I imagine better services exist for adults.
</p>

<p>
  On June 23 I had a scare. As I wrote in my journal, “I thought I’d totally lost my QWERTY muscle memory. I did some typing practice, then switched back to QWERTY [...] and found it really difficult to type accurately.” Luckily, after an hour or so, my QWERTY muscle memory came back. This incident taught me not to practice Workman right before work. Another time I did so, I typed slower and less accurately than usual for most of the workday. By contrast, this morning I practiced Workman, then showered and went for a walk. I started work an hour after I finished practicing and had no trouble using QWERTY.
</p>

<p>
  I haven’t been as diligent about practicing daily with TypingClub as I was with Keybr. I missed a couple of days in mid-June and four last week (partly because I went on vacation without a computer). Still, I’ve increased my Workman typing speed by about 13 words per minute (wpm) in the past month:
</p>

<p class="image">
  <img src="/blog/using-workman/typing-speed-graph.jpg" alt="A graph of my Workman typing speed over the past month. Each data point is the speed at which I typed when taking together all lessons completed on that day. A linear trendline with R2 = 0.655 goes from about 39 wpm on June 13 to about 52 wpm on July 10.">
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately this is faster than my real-world typing speed. I find I type faster when I can always see the next letter I need to type, as with Keybr and TypingClub but not when typing a chat message. But the change in speed feels roughly accurate. I think a small amount of this increase comes from higher accuracy but most is from improved muscle memory, both at the three-or-four-letter sequence level and at the word level.
</p>

<p>
  My speed isn’t improving as quickly as I’d like, which is why on July 5 I started using Workman full-time on my personal computer. So far it’s been slow going. I still haven’t found a way to use the same keyboard layout across all programs. My current solution affects Firefox and Discord but not my terminal emulator or Ubuntu settings. As I discovered, it’s difficult to switch quickly between layouts, so I need to find a better solution. I also discovered that the Workman keymap I’m using has a couple of bugs: the Caps Lock key is bound to both caps lock and backspace, and the left arrow key doesn’t work at all. The keymap is open-source so I’ll contribute the fixes back to the original project if I fix these issues before finding a different way to use Workman on Ubuntu (a friend of mine suggested a programmable keyboard).
</p>

<p>
  I’m still a ways from using Workman at work. I’m currently relearning common shortcuts like opening and closing new tabs, and even copy and paste. More importantly, I haven’t figured out how to avoid disrupting my Vim muscle memory. I’ll definitely rebind HJKL (equivalents for the arrow keys) to YNEO (the letters on the Workman keyboard triggered by the same keys as HJKL on QWERTY). But should I also rebind often-used Vim keys like I, A, Y, and P so that they don’t change position, or should I relearn the positions and keep the mnemonic key bindings (Insert, Append, Yank, and Paste respectively)? I haven’t decided yet.
</p>

<p>
  In any case, I’ll keep using Workman, with the goal of using it at work too. It’s subjective and potentially biased, but this keyboard layout does feel easier on my hands than QWERTY. I typed this blog post using Workman: Here’s to many more.
</p>

<p>
  P.S.: Here are two fun facts. First, this whole process hasn’t affected my phone-typing muscle memory at all. (It makes sense: Typing Workman on a keyboard is much more like typing QWERTY on a keyboard than typing QWERTY on a phone.) Second, it’s quite difficult to type the word “QWERTY” using Workman… Someday I’ll build the word-level muscle memory for it.

            <title><![CDATA[This blog has an RSS feed]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
  I recently added an
  <a href="https://thomasbroadley.com/blog/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> to my
  blog, prompted by a friend asking if I had one. I write these posts in
  HTML. I don’t use a static site generator. So I assumed I wouldn’t be
  able to generate a feed using existing software. (Later, I realized
  there exist tools that build an RSS feed from a given webpage. I
  looked at one and saw the feed it built didn’t have anywhere near the
  format I wanted.)
</p>

<p>
  I wrote
  <a
    href="https://github.com/tbroadley/thomasbroadley.com/blob/35270f4/blog/rss/index.ts"
    >a small TypeScript program</a
  >
  to generate the RSS feed. It uses
  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/htmlparser2"
    ><code>htmlparser2</code></a
  >
  to parse the posts and
  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rss"><code>rss</code></a> to
  generate the RSS feed from the contents.
</p>

<h2>The right tool for the job</h2>

<p>
  I soon realized <code>htmlparser2</code> wasn’t the easiest tool to
  use. The library uses a callback interface: It lets you provide
  functions that it then calls when it encounters opening and closing
  tags, text nodes, and other document features. It’s up to the code
  using the library to track its location in the parse tree.
</p>

<p>
  Instead, I could have used a library like
  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse5"><code>parse5</code></a
  >, which parses the HTML into a JavaScript object and makes it easy to
  access elements with known locations in the parse tree. It’s a
  tradeoff, though: If I’d written the script using that approach, small
  changes in the layout of the HTML would have broken it. In fact, I
  think it would have been easiest to write this script using browser
  APIs like <code>Document#querySelector</code>. For that reason, maybe
  I should have used a DOM implementation like
  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom"><code>jsdom</code></a
  >.
</p>

<h2>Parsing the posts</h2>

<p>
  In any case, solving this problem with <code>htmlparser2</code> was a
  fun challenge. I wanted to extract three pieces of information from
  each post: its title and creation date and the post body. First, I
  worked on extracting the title.
</p>

<p>
  I added callbacks for opening tags, closing tags, and text nodes.
  <code>htmlparser2</code> does a pre-order traversal of the parse tree:
  If you identify the calls to the opening and closing tag callbacks for
  a given element, any calls to the text node callback in between must
  be for text nodes inside that element. Each post’s
  <code>title</code> tag contains the title, so all I had to do was
  extract the text node inside that tag. Since each post only has one
  <code>title</code> tag, I did this by setting an
  <code>inTitle</code> variable to true when I saw an opening
  <code>title</code> tag, storing the contents of the text node seen
  when <code>inTitle</code> was true in a second variable, and setting
  <code>inTitle</code> to false on a closing <code>title</code> tag.
</p>

<p>
  I did something similar to extract the creation date, which is
  contained in a <code>p</code> tag with the class
  <code>timestamp</code>. The opening tag callback takes a map of HTML
  attributes as well as a tag name, so it was easy to recognize this
  particular <code>p</code> tag by its class. The closing tag callback
  doesn’t provide the tag’s attributes, but I realized I could set
  <code>inDate</code> to false on any closing <code>p</code> tag, since
  the paragraph containing the timestamp doesn’t have any paragraphs
  inside it.
</p>

<h2>Getting the post contents</h2>

<p>
  Extracting the contents of each post was more difficult. The body of
  each blog post lives in a <code>section</code> tag. It can contain
  HTML itself—so far I’ve mainly used <code>a</code> and
  <code>code</code> tags. However, <code>htmlparser2</code> doesn’t let
  you read the contents of a specific HTML element. It just calls your
  callback functions when it sees opening tags, closing tags, and text
  nodes. I needed to rebuild the HTML inside the
  <code>section</code> tag only using the information from these
  function calls.
</p>

<p>
  To keep track of whether it’s inside the <code>section</code> tag, the
  script uses an <code>inSection</code> Boolean variable, similar to how
  it keeps track of whether it’s inside the <code>title</code> tag. It
  appends any text it sees inside the <code>section</code> tag to a
  <code>content</code> string variable that starts off empty. When the
  script sees an opening tag inside the <code>section</code> tag, it
  uses the tag name and map of attributes to build a string containing
  an HTML opening tag, then appends it to <code>content</code>. This
  logic closes self-closing tags but leaves other tags open. On
  encountering a closing tag inside the <code>section</code>, the script
  appends a closing tag to <code>content</code>, as long as the tag
  isn’t self-closing. The pre-order traversal ensures the script appends
  tags and text to <code>content</code> in the same order it appears in
  the original post.
</p>

<h2>Generating the RSS feed</h2>

<p>
  Generating the feed was simpler. Each post lives in its own folder, so
  the script gets a list of those folders, reads and parses each post,
  adds an item to the feed for each parsed post, and writes the feed to
  an XML file. After running the script, I commit the updated file to my
  website’s Git repository and push to publish.
</p>

<h2>Why TypeScript?</h2>

<p>
  I wrote this script in TypeScript but didn’t benefit much from doing
  so compared to writing it in JavaScript. Most of the compile errors I
  encountered would have been runtime errors in JS, but the cause would
  have been equally obvious. On the other hand, I didn’t waste much time
  using TS. It didn’t take long to install <code>ts-node</code> and type
  definitions for the libraries I was using, and I don’t expect
  <code>ts-node</code> was much slower than Node for such a small
  script. Plus, I would have benefited more from TS with a different
  development environment. I wrote this script using Vim, without even
  TS syntax highlighting. If I’d used an IDE with type-aware code
  completion and integrated type-checking, or installed Vim plugins for
  those features, TS would have been an improvement over JS.
</p>

<h2>Why RSS?</h2>

<p>
  So why RSS? I’m a big consumer of RSS feeds myself and I know I’m not
  alone, even if they’re not as popular as they used to be. RSS is a
  simple way to share new content with people interested in your work.
  Of course, it’s not the only way. I could share my posts over Twitter
  or Facebook, but I started using RSS in the first place to get off
  social media. (A topic for another post.) Substack and Mailchimp make
  it easy to share content over email, but I like having full control
  over the distribution of my posts. I’d rather not give that control to
  a third party, at least for a passion project that I don’t plan to
  monetize, like this blog. I’d definitely consider using Substack for a
  paid newsletter to avoid integrating with a payment processor.
</p>

<h2>P.S.: Why not an SSG or a CMS?</h2>

<p>
  It’s also worth examining why I don’t use a static site generator or a
  CMS for my blog. I certainly could have built it more quickly using
  one of those tools. Well, again, I like having full control over my
  website, both its appearance and its code. A tool like Wordpress
  doesn’t give you that control without a lot of customization. I also
  appreciate that my website’s code is simple and human-readable.
  Finally, I enjoy solving problems and writing software. I don’t see
  the time spent working on projects like this one as wasted. I even
  enjoy the process of turning each post into an HTML document. It’s a
  good Vim exercise and the process somehow makes me feel more proud of
  my posts.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
  Edit: The day after publishing this blog post, I decided to move my
  posts into YAML files and generate both the HTML for them and my blog's
  RSS feed from those files. Each post shares a lot of code and it's
  painful to change something in all of them (e.g. adding a link to the header).
  Now that each post is based on a template HTML file, it's easy to make these
  kinds of changes. It's also a lot easier to parse YAML than HTML. And I still
  get to hand-edit each post's HTML! (Although I might look into generating them
  from Markdown instead.)

            <title><![CDATA[Project retrospective: EDM Scraper]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
  In 2016, I got into live music seriously for the first time. At first
  I found concerts by looking through long lists of ones in Toronto for
  artists I recognized. At the start of 2017 I decided to automate this
  process. Thus was born
  <a href="https://github.com/tbroadley/edm-scraper">EDM Scraper</a>: a
  service that sends mea daily email containing new concert listings
  near me.
</p>

<p>
  The project is a collection of Ruby scripts that scrape different
  webpages. To do the scraping, these scripts use the headless browser
  PhantomJS; the Capybara library, which can simulate interactions with
  many different browsers and is often used for Rails acceptance
  testing; and Poltergeist, a library that allows Capybara to interact
  with PhantomJS. Each script stores the scraped concert listings in a
  database. Finally, another script reads the database and sends me a
  digest of new and interesting concerts using the PostageApp
  email-sending service.
</p>

<p>
  My definition of “interesting” was nuanced, which was one reason I
  wasn’t satisfied with using Spotify or another service that lets you
  know about concerts for artists you follow. I particularly enjoy EDM
  shows, even when I don’t know the DJ well. I decided I wanted the
  service to email me whenever it found a new EDM concert. However, I
  also wanted an email when specific artists that I really liked, not
  limited to EDM producers, came to town. I created one scraper for a
  website with a comprehensive list of EDM shows in Toronto. I then
  added a second scraper for a website listing all Toronto concerts.
  This scraper only saves listings for concerts that match a list of
  artist names I’ve put together by hand.
</p>

<p>
  I decided to build EDM Scraper using Ruby because I’d previously used
  Capybara for end-to-end testing and scraping. I originally decided not
  to use Rails because I didn’t expect to use most of Rails’s
  functionality, but I now regret that decision. I did want to store
  concert listings in a database. I used ActiveRecord for this and found
  it more difficult than expected to integrate the library into the
  project. Instead, I should have let Rails handle the integration with
  ActiveRecord. I was also worried that setting up a Rails application
  would make it slower to start the project. In retrospect, this doesn’t
  make sense: the Rails CLI makes it easy to set up new projects.
</p>

<p>
  So far, I’ve only written tests for the logic-heavy parts of the
  project: parsing concert dates, deciding which artists to include in
  the email, and building the email itself. The scripts that scrape the
  web pages and send the emails don’t have automated tests. I found it
  easy enough to test those by running them on my computer. I set up the
  scripts so that they could either connect to the production PostgreSQL
  database, a local PostgreSQL database for development, or an instance
  of NullDB for automated testing. In fact, I often use the NullDB mode
  when manually testing scripts too. The database logic is centralized
  in an ActiveRecord model, so I don’t worry about bugs in how a
  specific script persists concerts.
</p>

<p>
  The nature of the project means that, if a script fails, the only
  symptom is not receiving an email, which I might not notice for a
  while. To remedy this, I wrapped each script in a function that would
  run the block passed to it, catching any exceptions thrown by the
  block and sending me an email if it did catch one. Of course, if the
  scripts can't email me, I still wouldn’t know that anything had gone
  wrong, but so far that hasn’t been a problem.
</p>

<p>
  Currently EDM Scraper runs on Heroku’s free tier. The free tier makes
  a lot of sense for this project because it’s mostly implemented using
  scheduled tasks with soft deadlines. It doesn’t matter if it takes an
  extra ten seconds for a free dyno to spin up. Eventually I did create
  <a href="http://edm-scraper.herokuapp.com">a simple webpage</a> that
  lists all future concert listings , but I don’t access it often enough
  to be bothered by the ten seconds I have to wait for the page to load.
</p>

<p>
  So far, I haven’t needed to put much effort into maintaining the
  project. A few times, one of my scrapers has balked at some new
  formatting on the page and I’ve had to adjust it slightly. I also
  added scrapers for shows in New York when I lived there in the summer
  of 2018, and more recently a scraper for virtual festivals occurring
  during the pandemic. Many of the commits in the project’s Git history
  are just adding more artists to my list. My next step for the project
  might be to fetch a list of artists I follow from Spotify, instead of
  maintaining the list by hand.

            <title><![CDATA[Learning Workman]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
  Recently I’ve been learning how to type using the
  <a href="https://workmanlayout.org/">Workman keyboard layout</a>. I’ve
  heard many times that QWERTY isn’t very ergonomic. I decided to learn
  a new keyboard layout to see how it’d affect my typing speed,
  accuracy, and comfort, and because it seemed like an interesting
  challenge. I must admit I didn’t do much research into the other
  alternative layouts. Basically, Workman’s excellent website convinced
  me to try it.
</p>

<p>
  I’ve been practicing around 15 minutes a day for the past two weeks.
  I’ve considered practicing more, but honestly I don’t find the process
  that fun. Plus, I already spend a lot of time typing, using my phone,
  and playing the piano and bass, so I don’t want to put too much more
  strain on my hands.
</p>

<p>
  I’m using <a href="https://keybr.com">Keybr</a> to learn Workman. It
  teaches you to type using many short lessons, 20 or 25 words each by
  default, composed of a randomly-generated mix of real and fake words.
  The fake words are either short, English-like sequences of letters or
  portmanteaus of two real words. You learn one letter at a time, only
  moving onto the next letter once you’ve mastered the current one.
</p>

<p>
  I started using Keybr to improve my QWERTY typing but found it
  annoying to use. I think that’s because I have word-level muscle
  memory for that keyboard layout. The fake words threw me off because
  they didn't exist in my muscle memory.
</p>

<p>
  Keybr works well for learning a new keyboard layout, though. Because
  of the fake words, the lessons don’t force you to type any one word
  too often, but are still full of common sequences of two to four keys
  containing the letter you’re currently learning. My hypothesis is that
  word-level muscle memory is built on top of muscle memory for these
  sequences. While learning a new key, I first gain muscle memory for
  the sequences enabled by introducing that key. For example, I learned
  I and N before learning G, so the lessons only included words ending
  in “ing” once I started learning G. Besides these sequences, I also
  build muscle memory for words of four letters or fewer that contain
  the new key. I then develop muscle memory for longer words. I looked
  for studies on motor learning that agreed or disagreed with this
  observation but couldn’t find any.
</p>

<p>
  I noticed a couple of factors that made a given key easier or more
  difficult to learn. It’s easy to analyze them using this graph from my
  Keybr profile:
</p>

<p class="image">
  <img
    alt="A graph from my Keybr profile. The x-axis is the typing lesson number, from 1 to 307. Each key has a row on the y-axis, sorted vertically by the lesson I started learning it. Each intersection of a lesson and a key contains a small rectangle, ranging from red for low speed and accuracy to green for high speed and accuracy (or white if I didn't practice that key in that lesson)."
    src="/blog/learning-workman/keybr-graph.jpg"
  />
</p>

<p>
  The graph’s x-axis is the typing lesson number. You can see I’ve done
  307 Workman lessons so far. Red sections represent lessons with lower
  speed and accuracy for that key, while green indicates higher speed
  and accuracy.
</p>

<p>
  I found it easy to learn letters that Workman and QWERTY assigned to
  the same key. Unfortunately, only three of the letter keys I've
  learned so far are in the same location: A, S, and G. The graph above
  demonstrates that I quickly learned A and S and haven’t lost that
  proficiency since. G has been more challenging, perhaps because it
  doesn’t appear in every lesson.
</p>
<p>
  It was also easier to learn letters that only showed up in short
  words. For example, in my first lessons for K, the letter appeared
  almost exclusively in three- or four-letter words like “take” and
  “ack”. According to the graph, it only took me a few lessons to learn
  K initially. However, when a later lesson reintroduced it in a longer
  word, I struggled to remember it.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, learning certain keys completely threw off my muscle memory
  for the keys I’d already learned. It was like my brain had to break
  down and restructure my existing muscle memory to take into account
  the new key.
</p>

<p>
  Take the R key as an example. It was one of the first six keys I
  learned. It only took me a few lessons to master it. However, my speed
  and accuracy for R have fallen several times while learning other keys
  (e.g. A and M). I’ve gone through a similar process of gaining and
  losing muscle memory with other keys, most dramatically D, H, and B.
</p>

<p>
  It’s frustrating to get less proficient at a key. I wonder whether it
  would have been faster to learn how to type all the keys at once
  instead of one at a time. I think I would have abandoned the process
  because of the steeper learning curve, though.
</p>

<p>
  So far, I’ve learned all the letter keys except for Z, X, Q, and J.
  After learning those, to help me build word-level muscle memory, I
  might switch from Keybr to a different typing practice tool that
  emphasizes typing real words and sentences. I might practice with
  <a href="https://github.com/tbroadley/gpt-2-github">a tool</a> I
  developed that uses GPT-2 to generate typing lessons based on a GitHub
  user’s PR comments. The goal of this project is to let me practice
  typing text that’s as similar to the text I’m typing on a daily basis
  as possible.
</p>

<p>
  I’ll also try out Workman at work and in my personal life. I found it
  easy to install the layout on Mac OS by following the instructions
  <a href="https://github.com/workman-layout/Workman/tree/master/mac"
    >here</a
  >. Ubuntu is more challenging. The GitHub repository I just linked to
  contains instructions for four different ways to enable Workman on
  Ubuntu. I don’t run <code>xfree86</code>, so that method isn’t an
  option. The <code>linux_console</code> and
  <code>xorg</code> approaches don’t work on my computer—I think they
  might only work on an older version of Ubuntu. The
  <code>xmodmap</code> approach enables Workman in Firefox but not in my
  terminal. I’ll have to keep investigating.
</p>

<p>
  I’ll write another post once I’ve determined if Workman helps me type
  faster, more accurately, or with less effort. Even if I go back to
  QWERTY, learning Workman has already paid dividends: The process has
  improved my QWERTY typing. I’ve started using the “correct” fingers on
  more distant keys. For example, I now use my right ring finger to type
  O and P, instead of my middle finger. I’m not sure how to quantify the
  impact of this, but I think it’ll slightly reduce the strain of
  typing.
</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Unlocking SSH keys using pass]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
  I use
  <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/"><code>pass</code></a> as my
  password manager. It stores passwords and other secrets as
  GPG-encrypted files in a Git repository. I host that repo on GitHub
  and have clones of it on my work and personal computers. I store
  nearly all of my personal passwords in <code>pass</code>, including
  passwords for my GitHub SSH keys. I’ve gone through three ways of
  unlocking these SSH keys.
</p>

<p>
  I started by running <code>pass -c SSH/Ubuntu</code> to copy my SSH
  key’s password to the keyboard, running a Git command like
  <code>git push</code>, then pasting my password into the prompt. I
  wasn’t satisfied with how much typing this process required. Plus,
  sometimes I’d forget to copy the password to my clipboard before
  running the Git command. I’d have to Ctrl+C that command and rerun it
  after copying the password. Even though I used
  <code>ssh-agent</code> and wasn’t unlocking my SSH key that often, I
  decided to automate this process.
</p>

<p>
  My second method used a script I called <code>sshpass</code>. Here it
  is in its entirety:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">#!/usr/bin/expect -f
set password [exec pass SSH/Ubuntu]

spawn ssh-add
expect "passphrase"
send -- "$password\r"
interact</code></pre>

<p>
  This is an <code>expect</code> script. According to
  <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/expect">its man page</a>,
  <code>expect</code> is “a program that ‘talks’ to other interactive
  programs according to a script”. In this case, the script instructs
  <code>expect</code> to store the output of
  <code>pass SSH/Ubuntu</code> in the variable <code>password</code>,
  then run <code>ssh-add</code>, wait for it to prompt for a password,
  and write the password to <code>ssh-add</code>’s stdin. For reasons I
  don’t totally understand, the <code>interact</code> command, which
  attaches the terminal’s standard streams to <code>ssh-add</code>’s, is
  necessary to let <code>ssh-add</code> finish running.
</p>

<p>
  Now, all I had to do was run <code>sshpass</code> before running a Git
  command, but I’d still sometimes forget to run <code>sshpass</code>.
  Finally, this week, I came across a third solution that addresses this
  issue on Linux, mainly based on
  <a
    href="https://blog.ona.io/technology/2020/03/02/using-password-manager-with-ssh.html"
    >this blog post</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  First, I added <code>AddKeysToAgent yes</code> to my SSH configuration
  at <code>~/.ssh/config</code>. This causes <code>ssh</code> to add
  keys to <code>ssh-agent</code> when they’re unlocked. This is
  important because we’ll no longer be explicitly calling
  <code>ssh-add</code>.
</p>

<p>Then, I added the following to my <code>.zshrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">eval $(ssh-agent) > /dev/null
export SSH_ASKPASS=~/ssh-pass-passphrase.bash
alias ssh="setsid -w ssh"
alias git="setsid -w git"</code></pre>

<p>
  This starts an instance of <code>ssh-agent</code>, then sets the
  <code>SSH_ASKPASS</code> environment variable. If this variable is
  set, when <code>ssh</code> needs a password to unlock an SSH key, it
  runs the script pointed at by the variable and uses the output as the
  password. Note that this only works if <code>ssh</code> isn’t run in a
  terminal. That’s the purpose of the aliases for <code>ssh</code> and
  <code>git</code>: <code>setsid</code> runs these programs in a new
  shell session that isn’t associated with the terminal in which I’m
  running <code>ssh</code> or <code>git</code>. The <code>-w</code> flag
  causes <code>setsid</code> to wait until <code>ssh</code> or
  <code>git</code> exits before exiting.
</p>

<p>
  <code>~/ssh-pass-passphrase.bash</code> is a script that writes my SSH
  key’s password to stdout:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">#!/bin/bash
pass SSH/Ubuntu</code></pre>

<p>
  Now, I can run Git commands without worrying if my SSH key is unlocked
  beforehand. If it isn’t, <code>ssh</code> automatically calls
  <code>pass</code> to get my SSH key’s password and unlocks the key
  before Git runs the command.
</p>

<p>
  So far, this setup only works on Ubuntu on my personal computer. My
  next step is to get it working on Mac OS, so I can use it on my work
  computer too. After that, I’d like to look into ways to avoid spawning
  an instance of <code>ssh-agent</code> in every terminal I run this
  command in.
</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rate-limit right before allocating]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
  At work last week, I built an API endpoint that allowed logged-out
  visitors to our website to create rows in a database table. I wanted
  to prevent bad actors from adding a bunch of nonsense data to the
  table, so I added rate-limiting based on the user’s IP address. I
  implemented the endpoint as follows: First, it checked the rate limit
  and responded with a 429 if the user had surpassed it. If not, it
  validated the user-provided request data and responded with a 400 if
  it found invalid data. If both checks were successful, it saved the
  valid data to the database.
</p>

<p>
  It was only by filling out the HTML form connected to this endpoint
  that I discovered a design flaw. When I submitted invalid data for the
  first time, I’d receive a 400. However, after quickly fixing the
  invalid data and resubmitting it, I’d receive a 429 and wouldn’t be
  able to submit the now-valid data until the rate limit expired. From a
  user’s perspective, this was a terrible experience: If they made an
  error while filling out the form, they’d have to wait several seconds
  each time they tried to correct it.
</p>

<p>
  I realized that I wanted to limit the number of requests per user that
  would actually create rows in the database, not the total number of
  requests. Therefore, I changed the endpoint to validate the request
  data, <i>then</i> check the rate limit. This way, the endpoint only
  rate-limits valid requests. Now users can submit many invalid requests
  in a short period of time while trying different ways to fix the
  invalid data.
</p>

<p>
  This problem has a mirror image. Suppose you were implementing an
  endpoint with a high CPU cost and wanted to prevent each user from
  making too many requests in a short period of time. Further, suppose
  you implemented the API endpoint to first construct a response to the
  user’s request, then check the rate limit. In this case, the rate
  limit has no effect: A user can still make a large number of requests
  to the endpoint and consume a lot of CPU, even though they receive
  429s for most of the requests. The solution is to rate-limit before
  performing the CPU-intensive operation.
</p>

<p>
  These problems point to a general principle. Rate-limiting prevents
  one user from using too much of a shared resource, e.g. database space
  or CPU. The principle is this: Rate-limit right before allocating part
  of that shared resource to a request. If you check the rate limit too
  late, the rate-limiting won’t effectively protect the resource. If you
  check it too early, you’ll end up rate-limiting requests that wouldn’t
  have consumed the resource anyway, which might be a poor experience
  for users.
</p>

<p>
  Edit (2020-05-30): A couple of my coworkers pointed out that this
  principle has tradeoffs. In the first example in this article, I added
  a direct call to a rate-limiter method to the endpoint. We wouldn't
  want to do that for every endpoint that adds rows to the database.
  Instead, we could implement a configurable database rate-limiting
  system that allows you to specify different rate limits for insertions
  to different tables. We might want to implement a similar system for
  each shared resource. Contrast this with a single system that only
  allows you to rate-limit the number of requests per endpoint. The
  former allows you to limit bad behaviour more aggressively without
  compromising user experience, but it might not be worth the extra
  complexity.
</p>

<p>
  A coworker also mentioned a second use for rate-limiting: preventing
  dictionary attacks, both on sensitive information, like passwords, and
  less sensitive information, like tokens that refer to database
  objects. I think it's possible to treat this as a special case of
  protecting shared resources by considering the search space as a
  shared resource, but I haven't fully worked out this metaphor yet.
</p>

  Yesterday I participated in a discussion group over voice chat. It was
  the first time in a couple of months that I’d had a real conversation
  with people I hadn’t met before. Making more friends is a goal of
  mine, but I often feel prevented from achieving that goal by social
  anxiety. Yesterday was no exception. When I woke up in the morning, I
  was already thinking about bailing on the discussion group.
</p>

<p>
  In the past, I’ve found that doing fulfilling solo activities helps me
  counteract this anxiety. So yesterday morning I did yoga, meditated,
  went on a bike ride to a park, cooked lunch, and sang. Even after all
  that, I was still feeling anxious about ten minutes before the
  meeting. As the meeting started, I saw the list of people in the voice
  chat room and felt intimidated by its size. I nearly let myself bail
  on the discussion group.
</p>

<p>
  Luckily, I took the opportunity to practice mindfulness. I took some
  deep breaths, closed my eyes, and focused on how I was feeling
  physically. I immediately noticed that my anxiety had manifested as a
  pit in my stomach. I focused on that sensation as well as I could and
  after a couple of minutes it mostly went away. I felt much calmer and,
  after a couple more minutes, I was able to join the voice chat room.
  I’m so glad I did. The discussion group was the highlight of my week.
</p>

<p>
  I hope I’ll remember to use this technique more in the future. I think
  I can apply it not just to social anxiety but also my tendency to
  procrastinate.

            <title><![CDATA[What would we do if we didn't do code review?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
  Every company I’ve worked at enforces peer code review before merging
  and deploying a pull request. I’ve been thinking about ways to improve
  this process for a while. Today I asked myself: If developers didn’t
  do code review, what would they do to achieve the same results?
</p>

<p>
  First, we need to ask: What is code review for? I’ll divide its
  benefits into three categories. The first contains the benefits of
  using automated code review tools. Type checkers, linters, and code
  formatters aren’t the only tools in this space. We can also check that
  pull requests don’t reduce test coverage or introduce untested code
  paths. To some extent, we can automatically enforce naming and commit
  message conventions. Tools can flag misuses of language features, the
  language’s standard library, and other libraries. We can also use
  static analysis, benchmarking, and profiling to look for performance
  issues. There’s a lot of room for creativity here. For example, at
  Faire, we implemented a tool that indicates when a pull request
  increases the size of our main JavaScript bundle.
</p>

<p>
  The second category includes conventions and checks that require human
  reasoning. Reviewers check that a pull request satisfies the
  requirements of the feature it implements, that the code is
  well-tested, and that the tests correctly describe the expected
  behaviour. Reviewers also provide feedback on comments and
  documentation, and ask the author to rewrite or comment unclear code.
  Finally, I’ve seen reviewers question whether it makes sense to
  implement the proposed change at all.
</p>

<p>
  The third category contains the harder-to-quantify benefits of having
  more than one person look at each pull request. Developers feel
  ownership for the code they review and responsibility for bugs that it
  introduces. Code review is a great way to share knowledge, both from
  reviewer to reviewee and vice versa. It also means that at least two
  people should be familiar with every line of code in the codebase,
  reducing the team’s bus factor. Finally, to build a sense of
  solidarity, it’s important for developers on the same team to work
  together on a daily basis.
</p>

<p>
  Looking at the benefits in the second and third categories, I see a
  common thread: They’re also the benefits of pair programming. While
  pairing, the observer can give the same kinds of feedback on code
  quality and functionality that a reviewer does. Even better, the
  driver gets this feedback as they’re writing the code, making it
  easier to integrate into the pull request. And pairing might be a
  better way to achieve the fuzzy goals in the third category, since
  developers collaborate in-person or over a voice or video call rather
  than through text.
</p>

<p>
  I don’t think pairing should completely replace code review. It’s
  possible that both developers working on a pull request are too close
  to the code and could benefit from a third opinion. Also, I find
  pairing more draining than writing code by myself. Some companies
  enforce constant pair programming—I wouldn’t be happy in that
  environment and I don’t think I’m alone.
</p>

<p>
  In any case, at the companies I’ve worked at, I’ve spent much more
  time reviewing code than pair programming. For example, this week, I
  spent about 90 minutes pairing and at least five hours reviewing code.
  I wonder what’d happen if we changed that balance. Perhaps we could
  encourage more pairing by waiving the code review requirement for pull
  requests that were paired on. That’d be an interesting experiment to
  run someday.
</p>
