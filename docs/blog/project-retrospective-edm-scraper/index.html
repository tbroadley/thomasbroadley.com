        <p>
          In 2016, I got into live music seriously for the first time. At first
          I found concerts by looking through long lists of ones in Toronto for
          artists I recognized. At the start of 2017 I decided to automate this
          process. Thus was born
          <a href="https://github.com/tbroadley/edm-scraper">EDM Scraper</a>: a
          service that sends mea daily email containing new concert listings
          near me.
        </p>

        <p>
          The project is a collection of Ruby scripts that scrape different
          webpages. To do the scraping, these scripts use the headless browser
          PhantomJS; the Capybara library, which can simulate interactions with
          many different browsers and is often used for Rails acceptance
          testing; and Poltergeist, a library that allows Capybara to interact
          with PhantomJS. Each script stores the scraped concert listings in a
          database. Finally, another script reads the database and sends me a
          digest of new and interesting concerts using the PostageApp
          email-sending service.
        </p>

        <p>
          My definition of “interesting” was nuanced, which was one reason I
          wasn’t satisfied with using Spotify or another service that lets you
          know about concerts for artists you follow. I particularly enjoy EDM
          shows, even when I don’t know the DJ well. I decided I wanted the
          service to email me whenever it found a new EDM concert. However, I
          also wanted an email when specific artists that I really liked, not
          limited to EDM producers, came to town. I created one scraper for a
          website with a comprehensive list of EDM shows in Toronto. I then
          added a second scraper for a website listing all Toronto concerts.
          This scraper only saves listings for concerts that match a list of
          artist names I’ve put together by hand.
        </p>

        <p>
          I decided to build EDM Scraper using Ruby because I’d previously used
          Capybara for end-to-end testing and scraping. I originally decided not
          to use Rails because I didn’t expect to use most of Rails’s
          functionality, but I now regret that decision. I did want to store
          concert listings in a database. I used ActiveRecord for this and found
          it more difficult than expected to integrate the library into the
          project. Instead, I should have let Rails handle the integration with
          ActiveRecord. I was also worried that setting up a Rails application
          would make it slower to start the project. In retrospect, this doesn’t
          make sense: the Rails CLI makes it easy to set up new projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          So far, I’ve only written tests for the logic-heavy parts of the
          project: parsing concert dates, deciding which artists to include in
          the email, and building the email itself. The scripts that scrape the
          web pages and send the emails don’t have automated tests. I found it
          easy enough to test those by running them on my computer. I set up the
          scripts so that they could either connect to the production PostgreSQL
          database, a local PostgreSQL database for development, or an instance
          of NullDB for automated testing. In fact, I often use the NullDB mode
          when manually testing scripts too. The database logic is centralized
          in an ActiveRecord model, so I don’t worry about bugs in how a
          specific script persists concerts.
        </p>

        <p>
          The nature of the project means that, if a script fails, the only
          symptom is not receiving an email, which I might not notice for a
          while. To remedy this, I wrapped each script in a function that would
          run the block passed to it, catching any exceptions thrown by the
          block and sending me an email if it did catch one. Of course, if the
          scripts can't email me, I still wouldn’t know that anything had gone
          wrong, but so far that hasn’t been a problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently EDM Scraper runs on Heroku’s free tier. The free tier makes
          a lot of sense for this project because it’s mostly implemented using
          scheduled tasks with soft deadlines. It doesn’t matter if it takes an
          extra ten seconds for a free dyno to spin up. Eventually I did create
          <a href="http://edm-scraper.herokuapp.com">a simple webpage</a> that
          lists all future concert listings , but I don’t access it often enough
          to be bothered by the ten seconds I have to wait for the page to load.
        </p>

        <p>
          So far, I haven’t needed to put much effort into maintaining the
          project. A few times, one of my scrapers has balked at some new
          formatting on the page and I’ve had to adjust it slightly. I also
          added scrapers for shows in New York when I lived there in the summer
          of 2018, and more recently a scraper for virtual festivals occurring
          during the pandemic. Many of the commits in the project’s Git history
          are just adding more artists to my list. My next step for the project
          might be to fetch a list of artists I follow from Spotify, instead of
          maintaining the list by hand.
