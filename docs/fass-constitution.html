              Should no suitable candidate for a position be found, applications
              for that position may be extended by the President. The F.A.S.S.
              President should make sure that potential applicants are provided

              application; this information is listed in the F.A.S.S. Principles

              applications, the Board will interview all available applicants
              for these positions.
